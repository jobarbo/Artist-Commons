uuuuu# What Am I making (The Ontology of Art)

## Session 1: The Analytic Canon

The goal

1. Know the major theories - understand what they claim
2. Use them as tools - apply them to your own practice

The format:

- Talk + Reflection Questions + Q&a at the end.
- Post follow ups on Mighty Network.

The four core questions (to better understand my practice)

- **Quarter 1**: What am I making?
  - "I make stuff but is it art?"
  - -> "Here's what makes my work art and why."
  - Philosophical territory: ontology and definition
- **Quarter 2**: How does it mean?
  - "I hope people understand it..."
  - -> "Here's how my art creates meaning."
  - Philosophical territory: Semiotics and communication
- **Quarter 3**: Where do I fit?
  - "Everything has already beend done!"
  - -> "Here is my lineage & my contribution"
  - Philosophical territory: Originality and authorship
- **Quarter 4**: Why does it matter?
  - "Is my work saying anything important?"
  - -> "Here is why my work matters"
  - Philosophical territory: Value and function

Two philosophical traditions:

- Analytic philosophy
  - Emphasis on precise deifnitions, logical analysis, clear arguments
  - What IS {x}
    - Trying to find the boundaries of a category
- Continental philosophy
  - Emphasis on lived experience, historical context, how things show up for us
  - What does {x} DO?
    - What's at stake when we use a category?

These theories are canon and have a lot of problem (male and white centric)

- but they are still present in the industry of art.

Ontology is the philosphical study of what things ARE, or the study of BEING.

- What **kinds** of things exist? How should we **categorize** them?

**Ontology of art asks**:
"What IS art? What makes something art rather than something else? how do we define the category of art?"

### Four Frameworks

**1. Art as Imitation/Representation**
**2. Art as Aesthetic Form**
**3. Art as Institutional Recognition**
**4. Art as Open Concept**

---

### <u>Framework 1</u>

#### Art as Imitation / Mimesis

Art is : Things that imitate or represent the world (mimesis)

#### Plato: Art as imperfect Imitation.

Plato wasn't a big fan of art.

PLato at 3 tier of the essence of the world.

- Tier 1 : Forms (Perfect, eternal ideals )
  - Perfect circle, perfect concept of justice or beauty for example. Ideal realms
- Tier 2 : Physical world
  - Imperfect copies of the eternal ideals
- Tier 3 : Art
  - Copies of the imperfect copies.

So for Plato, art is an imitation of an imitation (shadow of a shadow)

"Artists traffic in appearances not truth"

#### Aristotle: Art as Teacher.

Art is imitation... but Imitation is not a deception
Imitation is how we learn.

Takeaway: **Art is a knowledge practice, not a lie**

The artist skills is measured by how well they can capture reality.

##### Where it breaks down

What about sound art, abstract painting, conceptual art, Social practice

#### <u>Representation & New Technologies</u>

Is Mechanical reproduction art? (ie, Photography?)

Photography became art by showing it involved artistic choices, not just pointing a camera.

#### <u>Jacques Rancière Rethinking</u>

Mimesis is not just about copying...

it's a regime for organizing what's visible and sayable.

Representational regimes determine what is worth representing and how.

##### <u>Samia Halaby</u>

- Palestinian artist
- Make abstract painting since the 60's
- No recognizeable object, pure color.
- One of the pioneers of computer art.

She talks about her abstraction as grounded in the observation of nature

She's not copying nature but investigating structures and relationships of nature.

You might not be copying the world but you are exploring something about the world, about perception systems and structures or challenging what count as art or who get to makes art.

##### <u>Tara Donovan</u>

- Large scale installation
- Using every day object.
- Arrange them to create massive installation

What is she imitating?

But she is making choices by her composition or materials

These choices result in the viewer seeing the instalation as representation of the world anyway (clouds, natural phenomena, landscape)

Our mind are wired in seeing representation.

So the question becomes: is representation in the object or in the act of the viewer?

#### <u>For My practice</u>

What am I making visible in my work that wasn't visible before?

This could be a subject, a perspective a process or a way of seeing.

Answer:

1. I'm making visible the evolution of my work through an iterative workflow inspired by the theory on the evolution of species. Each work is related to an ancestor work or idea.

2. I'm trying to put a spotlight on the similarities between the structure we see in the natural work and how computer and mathematic works.

### <u>Framework 2</u>

#### Art as Aesthetic Form

Art is : Things that Create **aesthetic experience** through **formal properties**

#### <u>Immanuel Kant (1790)</u>

When you experience beauty , he calls it "Disinterested pleasure"

Not asking "can I use this" or "do I want to own this?"
Just contemplating. **Pure aesthetic attention**

**"Purposiveness without purpose"**

#### <u>Clive Bell (1914)</u>

He published a book called "ART"

Bell take Kant's idea about aesthetic experience and turn them into something he calls "Significant Form"

What all artworks share: Combinations of lines, colors, shapes that move us **aesthetically** (Art is aesthetic form)

#### <u>Clement Greenberg (1960's)</u>

Every art form should pursue what is unique to it.

**Medium Specificity**

Each art foprm should pursue its unique formal properties.

Ie. For painting: **Flatness**
Painting is pain on a flat surface, so modern painting should emphasize flatness, not create illusions of depth.

JB: Like when some people says that generative art should not take element from analog art.

##### <u>Where It Breaks Down</u>

Formalism isn't dead, it's just not sufficient on it's own.

Form and content arent separated but entagled together.

Artist doesn't stay in their lane.

<u>Post-Medium Condition</u>

Maybe your medium is a practice (multiple medium)

**The medium is whatever you keep doing or the recursive logic of your practive - Rosalind Krauss**

The medium might not be a substance but a question you keep asking or a process you keep returning to (git?).

#### <u>For My practice</u>

How much am I thinking about aesthetic when I'm creating?

**Where do I fall on this spectrum?**

- Pure formalism (form is everything)
- Form Serve concept (both matter)
- Form is secondary (concept/message is primary)

answer : Between 1 and 2. Form isn't everything but it's a big part of my work since I explore aesthetic a lot when I'm creating, then meaning comes after because seeing the work stirs emotions in me. From then on I can explore concepts once the form is locked in.

What would be lost if you work looked completely different but communcated the same idea?
As long as the work still moves me, it's fine.

### <u>Framework 3</u>

#### Art as Institutional Recognition

Art is : Things that get conferred **art-status** by the **art-world**

What makes it art is that the work get's treated as art.

The artworld is the institution that decides what's in and what's out.

#### <u>Arthur Danto (1964)</u>

Why are these Brillo boxes art when you can find them at the supermarket

**You can't tell what's art just by looking**

Something becomes art when it's presented in an art context, with art theories and art history behind it.

<u>Dickie's Institutional Theory</u>

Art is what gets conferred art-status by representatives of the artworld.

**Art is a status that gets conferred from outside the object, not a quality that lives inside it.**

Art is not intrinsic to the work but extrinsic.

<u>Bourdieu's Field Theory</u>

He developed the concept of cultural capital and field theory

The artworld is a field with its own logic, its own forms of value and its own gatekeepers.

Bourdieu's insight: Taste isn't natural or personal. it's socially constructed and reinforces power structures.

For artists it means that making good work isn't good enough. you need to accumulate cultural capital, be fluent in discource. Every field has it's own capital and gatekeepers and art is not different.

<u>Legitimation</u>

Basquiat was a graffiti artist, then he moved to gallery work and became one of the most succesful artist in history. once institutions started to embrace his work, they went back and appraised his street tag as well and some of them are now in museum.

The context didn't change the present, it rewrote the past.

#### <u>Andrea Fraser</u>

Museum Highlights (1989).

What makes the object in the museum art? (artowrk vs non art object like fountains)

**It is not a question of being against the institution. We ARE the institution**

<u>Understanding Cultural Capital</u>

- Credential Capital?
  - Do you have an MFA (where is it from)
- Institutional Affiliation?
  - IS your work shown in certain galleries
- Critical Validation?
  - Being written about?
- Linguistic Capital?
  - writing an artist statement using the right vocabulary
- Knowledge Capital?
  - Can you discuss you work in relationship to art history
- Social Capital?
  - Do you have connectionwith curators, collectors and galleries

None of this relate to the actual work of art.

#### <u>For My practice</u>

**What institutions or contexts would confer art-status on your work?**
A: Galleries, Art center, Other artists from where I'm based, Recognition by canadian or Quebec institutions, Media appearances (articles, TV,web)

**Which ones do you actually care about?**
A: Anything that is willing to respect the work and the medium. That is open minded.

**What cultural capital do you need to be recognized by them.?**
A: Contacts, Knowledge of the art world, Knowing how to write about my work to enter open calls, Openness about digital art as a medium (but thats out of my control)

### <u>Framework 4</u>

#### Art as an Open Concept

Art is : Things that share **family resemblances** with other things called art

#### <u>Morris Weitz</u>

**"Art is an open concept. You can't define it"**

#### <u>Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance</u>

IE: What do all games have in common?

No single feature unites them all. Instead they have overlapping similarities.

#### <u>Boris Groys</u>

"Art is defined by producing the NEW within art discourse"

**The archive and the trash Heap**

Innovation happens when something from outside gets pulled into the "archive"

(See Duchamp Urinal)

#### <u>Performance Art (60's - 70's)</u>

Gradually performance joined the art "family" because it was talked about by critics and curator's.

#### <u>Hito Steyerl</u>

why is it art?
Instutional recognition but alsol She brought element that was outside the "archive"

- Essay film
- Academic lecture
- Internet aesthetic
  All into contemporary art.

Video tutorial about become invisible in the digital age.

#### <u>Cameron Rowland</u>

-Attica Series Desk, 2016.

#### <u>For My practice</u>

Think about what is new in your work

What are you bringing into the archive that wasn't here before.

---

**What existing art practices does your work resemble?**
A: Algorithmic or rule base art.

**Make a list of 3-5 artists, movements, or practices your work connects to.**

- Generative art
- The automatists
- Tyler Hobbs (flow field)
- Matt deslauriers (use of particles)

**Then ask: what's different? What are you doing that's NEW in relation to those practices?**
A: IDK maybe bridging medium like I did with the dance groupe and my particle engine, or my step frame video animation using total new render of the same hash

### <u>Four Frameworks</u>

1. Art as imitation/representation
2. Art as Aesthetic Form
3. Art as institutional Recognition
4. Art as an Open Concept

Not Competing Truths, just different tools.
