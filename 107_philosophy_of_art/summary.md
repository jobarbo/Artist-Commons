# Philosophy of Art: What Am I Making?
## The Ontology of Art (Session 1: The Analytic Canon)

**Speaker:** Dr. Rebecca Millsop

---

## Overview

This lecture introduces four major philosophical frameworks for understanding what makes something art. The goal is not to debate which theory is "correct" but to provide tools for articulating why your work is art and understanding your practice more deeply.

### Year-Long Journey: Four Core Questions

1. **Q1: What am I making?** (Ontology & definition)
   - From: "I make stuff, but is it art?"
   - To: "Here's what makes my work art and why."

2. **Q2: How does it mean?** (Semiotics & communication)
   - From: "I hope people understand it..."
   - To: "Here's how my art creates meaning."

3. **Q3: Where do I fit?** (Originality & authorship)
   - From: "Everything has already been done!"
   - To: "Here is my lineage & my contribution."

4. **Q4: Why does it matter?** (Value & function)
   - From: "Is my work saying anything important?"
   - To: "Here is why my work matters."

## Philosophical Traditions

### Analytic Philosophy
- Emphasizes precise definitions, logical analysis, clear arguments
- Main question: **"What IS X?"**
- Goal: Find the boundaries of a category

### Continental Philosophy
- Focuses on lived experience, historical context, how things show up in our lives
- Main question: **"What does X DO?"**
- Goal: Understand what's at stake when we use a category

**Note:** While these traditions are distinct, there's real overlap. Both will be explored throughout the year.

---

## Key Concept: Ontology

**Ontology** = The philosophical study of what things ARE, or the study of what kinds of things exist.

**Ontology of Art asks:**
- What IS art?
- What makes something art rather than something else?
- How do we define the category of art?

This might seem abstract, but it's foundational—if you don't know what you're making, how can you talk about what it means or why it matters?

## Framework 1: Art as Imitation/Representation (Mimesis)

**Core Claim:** Art is things that imitate or represent the world.

### Plato (4th century BCE)
- **Not a fan of art**
- Three-tiered metaphysics:
  1. **Forms** - Perfect, eternal ideals (perfect circle, perfect bed, perfect justice)
  2. **Physical World** - Imperfect copies of the forms
  3. **Art** - Copies of imperfect copies (shadows of shadows)
- Art is **twice removed from truth**
- Artists "traffic in appearances, not truths"
- Banned poets from his ideal society (Republic) because they make us feel strongly about things that aren't real

### Aristotle (Plato's student)
- **Disagreed with Plato about art**
- Yes, art is imitation (mimesis), but imitation is **how we learn**
- Art doesn't just copy surfaces—it **reveals universal truths through particular instances**
- Example: A tragedy shows specific characters, but teaches us about fate, hubris, human suffering
- **Art is valuable because of mimesis, not despite it**
- Art is a **practice of knowledge**, not deception

### Historical Context
For 2,000+ years, this was the dominant definition. Artist skill was measured by how well they captured reality: perspective, anatomy, representational accuracy.

### Where It Breaks Down
- Abstract painting: What is a color field imitating?
- Conceptual art: Kosuth's "One and Three Chairs"—what's being imitated?
- Performance art, sound art, social practice—not representational at all
- Even representational art can be non-realistic (Francis Bacon's Screaming Popes)

### New Technologies Challenge
**Photography (19th century):** Is mechanical reproduction art? Does perfect imitation make it art or disqualify it?
- Photography became art by showing it involved **artistic choices**, not just mechanical capture
- Alfred Stieglitz: soft-focus, painterly images
- Ansel Adams: composition, light, constructed nature of the image

### Contemporary Rethinking: Jacques Rancière
- Mimesis is not just about copying
- It's a **regime for organizing representation**—what counts as worthy of representation and how
- Representational regimes determine what's visible and what's invisible, what's shown and what's sayable
- Helps us understand how abstract/non-representational work still operates within systems of visibility and meaning

### Examples

**Samia Halaby** (Palestinian artist)
- Abstract paintings since the 1960s, pure color and form
- Pioneer of digital abstract art (1980s), writes her own code
- Not copying nature, but investigating visual principles observed in natural phenomena
- Challenges regimes of representation: Palestinian woman working in abstraction and digital media
- Making visible what was excluded from dominant Western narratives

**Tara Donovan**
- Large-scale installations from everyday materials (plastic cups, toothpicks, styrofoam)
- Not representing anything specific, but viewers see geological formations, organisms, natural phenomena
- **Key question:** Is representation in the object or in the act of the viewer?
- Our brains are wired to look for representations

### Reflection Question
**What are you making visible in your work that wasn't visible before?**
(This could be a subject, perspective, process, or way of seeing)

## Framework 2: Art as Aesthetic Form

**Core Claim:** Art creates aesthetic experiences through formal properties—line, color, shape, composition, rhythm, balance.

### Immanuel Kant (1790)
- One of the most important philosophers in Western tradition
- Published book on aesthetics: *Critique of Judgment*
- **Key concepts:**
  - **Disinterested pleasure** - Not asking "can I use this?" or "what does it mean?" Just contemplating the thing itself
  - **Purposiveness without purpose** - A beautiful thing feels intentional but its purpose is not for anything specific
- Kant didn't claim this is what art should be, but later thinkers ran with these ideas

### Clive Bell (1914)
- British art critic, part of the Bloomsbury Group (Virginia Woolf's circle)
- Published book titled *Art*
- Introduced **"Significant Form"**
- What all artworks share: combinations of lines, colors, shapes that move us aesthetically
- **Radical claim:** Representational content is totally irrelevant
- A sunset painting and a Kandinsky abstraction can both have significant form or both lack it
- **"If it moves you through its formal properties, it's art"**

### Clement Greenberg (1960s)
- American art critic, champion of Abstract Expressionism (Pollock, de Kooning, Rothko)
- Took formalism even further with **"Medium Specificity"**
- Each art form should pursue what's unique to it, what only that medium can do
- For painting: **Flatness**—painting is on a flat surface, so emphasize flatness, stop creating illusions of depth
- This was **prescriptive**: "This is what good art should be doing"
- Became the dominant critical framework for abstract expressionism and color field painting

### Where It Breaks Down (1970s-80s)
- **Too narrow:** What about content? (Kara Walker's silhouettes are formally striking, but can you ignore the content about American history and violence?)
- **Politics & identity:** If aesthetic experience is universal, why did "great art" keep looking like white European men? Pure form conveniently ignored whose work got celebrated vs. dismissed
- **Art that refuses the object:** John Cage's 4'33", Marina Abramović's durational performances
- **Greenberg's blind spots:** Hostile to Pop Art and Warhol—if your framework can't account for significant art of its time, that's a problem

### But Formalism Isn't Dead
Artists still make formal decisions. We still have aesthetic experiences. Form and content aren't opposed—they're **tangled together**.

### Contemporary Examples

**Julie Mehretu**
- Large-scale paintings (15+ feet wide)
- Layers architectural drawings, abstract gesture marks, incredibly complex surfaces
- Critics discuss both:
  - **Content:** politics, globalization, migration, capital flows, erasure, memory
  - **Form:** How layering creates depth, how fragments create rhythm
- Her formal choices are part of how the work creates meaning
- You're taken in by the experience first, then brought to the conceptual content

**William Forsythe** (Choreographer)
- Came from classical ballet, completely reimagined it
- Work discussed in formalist terms: geometries of bodies in space, lines, volumes, patterns
- But also conceptually rich: questioning ballet's hierarchies, gender dynamics, relationship to music
- Example: form and content working together

### Post-Medium Condition: Rosalind Krauss
- Greenberg's student, art critic
- Artists don't "stay in their lanes"—they work across media, combine practices
- **New definition of medium:** Not a material (paint, bronze, pixels) but **"whatever you keep doing"**
- The recursive logic of your practice
- Your medium might be a **question you keep asking**, a **process you keep returning to**, or a **problem you're working through**

### Reflection Question
**Where do you fall on the spectrum?**
- Pure formalism (form is everything)
- Form serves concept (both matter equally)
- Form is secondary (concept/message is primary)

**What would be lost if your work looked completely different but communicated the same idea?**

## Framework 3: Art as Institutional Recognition

**Core Claim:** Art is things that get conferred art-status by the art world. Art is a **social category**, not a natural one.

### Arthur Danto (1964)
- American philosopher and critic
- Published in both analytic philosophy journals and *Artforum*
- **Defining moment:** Saw Warhol's Brillo Boxes at a gallery
- **Key question:** Why are these Brillo boxes art when the ones in the supermarket aren't?
- They're visually identical—**you cannot tell by looking**
- Answer: Context, theory, and art history matter
- What makes something art is that it's embedded in the **"art world"**—ecosystem of galleries, critics, collectors, education, art history
- Without that framework, Warhol's boxes are just boxes

### George Dickey: Institutional Theory
- Formalized Danto's insight
- Art is what gets conferred art-status by **representatives of the art world**
- The art world is a social institution, a system
- Certain people have authority to say "This is art": museum directors, curators, gallery owners, collectors, art historians, MFA program directors
- They don't all have to agree, but there's a network whose recognition matters
- **Radical insight:** Art isn't defined by intrinsic properties (qualities in the object itself)
- Art status is **conferred from outside**, not a quality that lives inside it

### Pierre Bourdieu: Cultural Capital & Field Theory
- French sociologist
- The art world is a **field**—structured social space with its own logic, forms of value, gatekeepers
- To succeed, you need **cultural capital** (not money—that's economic capital)
- **Cultural capital includes:**
  - Knowledge, credentials, taste, connections, right vocabulary
  - Knowing art history, speaking discourse fluently
  - Showing in right galleries, knowing right critics
- **Key insight:** Taste is not natural or personal—it's **socially constructed** and reinforces power structures
- People with cultural capital get to define what counts as art
- **For artists:** Making good work isn't enough—you need to accumulate cultural capital and be fluent in discourse

### Historical Examples

**Marcel Duchamp** (century ago)
- Took a urinal, signed it "R. Mutt," submitted to exhibition
- Object barely changed—still a urinal
- What made it art: **presenting it in an art context**

**Street Art & Graffiti**
- 1970s-80s: purely vandalism, arrests, jail time
- **Basquiat:** Started as SAMO tags on NYC streets, moved to galleries, became one of most expensive artists at auction
- Once institutions embraced him, they **went back and conferred art status on early street work**
- SAMO tags now in museum collections
- **The context didn't change the present—it rewrote the past**

### Andrea Fraser: Institutional Critique
**Museum Highlights (1989)**
- Performance at Philadelphia Museum of Art
- Gave tour as fictional docent "Jane Castleton"
- Treated **everything** with art historical analysis: bathrooms, water fountains, museum shop, architecture
- Asked: What makes objects in museums art? Is it simply the museum context?
- Most famous statement: **"It's not a question of being against the institution. We ARE the institution."**
- Artists, critics, curators, collectors—all together constitute the art world
- You can't critique it from outside because **there is no outside**
- Even artists working "outside" institutions still operate within them

### Forms of Cultural Capital
- **Credential capital:** MFA? From where? (Yale, RISD)
- **Institutional affiliation:** Showing in certain galleries
- **Critical validation:** Written about in *Art in America*, *Artforum*
- **Linguistic capital:** Artist statement using right vocabulary
- **Knowledge capital:** Discuss work in relation to art history
- **Social capital:** Connections to curators, critics, collectors

**None of these are about the quality of the work itself.**

### Why Diversity Matters
The people who hold cultural capital get to define what good art is. Representation and diversity throughout the art world matters because it changes who gets to make these decisions.

### Reflection Questions
- What institutions or contexts would confer art-status on your work?
- Which ones do you actually care about?
- What cultural capital do you need to be recognized by them?

## Framework 4: Art as Open Concept

**Core Claim:** Art is an open concept that keeps changing and expanding. Stop trying to define it with necessary and sufficient conditions.

### Morris Weitz (1956)
- American philosopher working in aesthetics
- Essay argued: **"Stop trying to define art. You can't do it."**
- Art is an **open concept**—any definition you come up with, some new artwork breaks it
- There's always a counter-example
- Art keeps changing, keeps expanding—**that is its nature**

### Ludwig Wittgenstein: Family Resemblance
- One of most influential philosophers of 20th century (Austrian, worked at Cambridge)
- Transformed philosophy twice (once early career, again later when he changed his mind)
- **Concept:** Words function through family resemblance, not single definitions
- Example: **"Game"**—word games, chess, football, solitaire, hide-and-seek
- All are games, but is there ONE property they all share?
- No single feature unites them—instead, **overlapping similarities** like family members
- One has mom's nose, another has dad's eyes, but no one feature everyone has
- Weitz applied this to art: painting, sculpture, performance, conceptual art, sound art
- All called art because they **share some features with other art**, not because there's one essential property

### Boris Groys: Innovation & Newness
- Contemporary German philosopher and art theorist (writes for *e-flux*)
- If art is always expanding, **what drives that expansion?**
- Answer: **Newness**
- **The Archive vs. The Trash Heap**
  - **Archive:** Everything already recognized as valuable (canons, museum collections, art history books)
  - **Trash Heap:** Stuff not yet recognized
  - **Innovation:** When something from outside the archive gets pulled in
- Example: Duchamp's urinal existed in trash heap (plumbing store, commodity object)—he pulled it into the archive, now it's canonical
- **Key insight:** The art system needs to constantly expand and innovate to survive—it feeds on the new
- Safe, familiar work doesn't expand the archive
- **The system rewards newness, novelty, and expansion**

### Contemporary Examples

**Performance Art (1960s-70s)**
- Abramović, Ulay, Chris Burden
- Initial reaction: "Is this art? Are you serious?"
- No object, nothing to sell, no aesthetic form
- Gradually joined the art "family" because:
  - It resembled art in important ways (shown in galleries, discussed by critics)
  - It was radically new
- In Groys's framework: pulled elements from theater, ritual, endurance, spectacle into the archive

**Hito Steyerl** (German artist and theorist)
- Makes video essays shown in museums and biennials
- Writes theory published in journals and academic texts
- Could be called artist, filmmaker, theorist—is she all? None?
- **"How Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File"** (2013)
  - Video tutorial about becoming invisible in digital age
  - Looks like YouTube instructional video
  - Shown in museums as art
- Why is it art? Institutional recognition + **it's new within discourse**
- Brought forms from outside archive: essay film, academic lecture, internet aesthetics

**Cameron Rowland**
- Work that looks like sculpture but functions as economic and political intervention
- 2016 show at Artist Space: displayed objects available for **rent, not purchase**
- Desk manufactured by prisoners at Attica, oak courtroom benches, shipping container bars
- One piece: legal document creating trust that purchased Aetna shares, held until US pays reparations
- Is this sculpture? Political organizing? Both?
- The art market itself becomes the medium
- **New is expanding within discourse**

### Reflection Questions
- What existing art practices does your work resemble?
- Make a list of 3-5 artists, movements, or practices your work connects to
- Then ask: What's different? What are you doing that's NEW in relation to those practices?
- What are you bringing into the archive that wasn't there before?
- What is your relationship to innovation and newness?

## Summary: Four Frameworks as Tools

1. **Art as Imitation/Representation** - 2,000+ year tradition from Plato to contemporary concerns about visibility
2. **Art as Aesthetic Form** - Focus on formal properties, aesthetic experience (Kant, Bell, Greenberg, Krauss)
3. **Art as Institutional Recognition** - Art as social category conferred by the art world (Danto, Dickey, Bourdieu, Fraser)
4. **Art as Open Concept** - Art as constantly expanding category with family resemblances (Weitz, Wittgenstein, Groys)

**These are not competing truths—they're different tools.**

You might be making work that:
- Is representational
- Creates aesthetic experience through form
- Needs institutional recognition
- AND expands the art field through newness

Understanding where and how these frameworks apply to your practice is what matters.

## Key Takeaways

### The Goal
Move from uncertainty ("I make stuff, but is it art?") to clarity ("Here's what makes my work art and why").

### Next Session
Q2 will address the same question from the **continental tradition** lens in 5 weeks.

### Acknowledgments
- The canon has problems (overwhelmingly white, European, male)
- But these theories are institutionally significant
- Learn the dominant language so you can speak it, critique it, or choose something else entirely
- The lecture intentionally brings in diverse voices and contemporary examples throughout

### On Capital-T Truth and Beauty
When we try to be too strict about ideals, we run into counterexamples. The world and art are **messier** than philosophical systems might like. Form and content, aesthetics and politics, object and context—they're all **tangled together**.

## Q&A Highlights

**On Plato's "perfect bed":** Not perfect as in cozy/comfortable, but perfect as in pure "bedness"—strip away everything accidental and particular to get to the underlying essence.

**On formalism today:** Formalism isn't dead, it's just not sufficient on its own. Artists still care deeply about formal qualities while doing other things. Form and content are inseparable.

**On playing the institutional game:** You get to decide if you care about having your work seen in certain places. If you do, you need to play the game. But in resisting, you might bring something from the "trash heap" that gets recognized anyway. Even outsider artists (like Henry Darger) can become part of the art world later.

**On whether art definitions will keep growing:** If you take the open concept framework seriously (Weitz, Groys, Wittgenstein), then yes—by its nature, the concept of art will continue to change. If you take a more rigid framework, you'll have to fight to keep things stable.
