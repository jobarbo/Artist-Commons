It's so good to have you all here with us again for our kickoff of our third week of lectures. Two of our cohort sessions have already happened, and we have two more coming up. But I've been really excited about how the cohorts came together. I feel like everybody, Laura and I talked a lot about who would work well together in groups and how your disciplines would speak to one another and experience levels would mesh well so you could have the level of conversation that you're looking to have to grow this year in your art practice.
So I'm excited for us to spend the next two and a half weeks continuing to get to know where we've been as we lay the groundwork for making sure we are prepared for what we're doing next in our vulnerable and honest work with one another to help us push forward. So I'm pleased today to have Dr. Rebecca Milsap with us to talk about the philosophy of art. One of the things we've talked about is how as we move into talking about the business side of art, we're going to need to continue to We need to practice figuring out what our work means, what it's about and how it's about it. And for us to do that, we need philosophy. And so I'm going to just hand it off right away to Rebecca because there is so much to cover today and I'm so excited for that.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:23
Hello! Thank you so much for having me. I am very excited to be here to talk about the ontology of art. I'm going to start by giving a little bit of an intro into how this is going to work, what this class, what this talk is going to be like, how this is going to track into the future of this year.
And then we're going to dive in. I have a lot of stuff to share with you. And my goal is really that you find some things to hold on to, you find things to be interested in. Tomorrow, I'm going to be sharing a document that covers a lot of the sort of deeper content that I'm discussing.
So don't worry too much about taking obsessive notes. Again, this is all going to be on replay as well.
So let's talk about how this is going to work. This is not a traditional philosophy class. And I want to be really clear about that. We're not doing argument analysis. We're not going to debate which theory is correct. I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty. My goal really is first to introduce these theories so that you can have some understanding of them, some foothold into them, understand what they claim and use them as tools. How can you apply them to your own practice?
So again, I'm going to be giving you a lot of information. And it's really about where you find your foothold in all of it. The format. I'm going to talk a lot. I'm going to show you some slides and I'm going to go over four different theories. After every theory, there will be a Period of reflection. I'm going to offer you a reflection question. We're going to take about three minutes to just be silent, reflect, and think about how this hits you in your practice. There will be Q&A at the end.
So please do drop in questions as we go. I'll be able to get to them at the end. If anything feels really pertinent, Hira will jump in and let me know. And I will be interacting on our Mighty Network space.
So any questions that I don't get to, or if you have questions afterwards, if you're watching this recording, you can still ask questions and I will show up to engage in that space. This is my passion. I love talking about it. It will not be a bother. All right.
So... , This is the journey that we're going to go on together throughout the year. We're going to explore four core questions. Hopefully these questions can help you better understand your practice. Each quarter, we're going to cover a different question.
So, quarter one, where we are now, the question is, what am I making? I'm thinking about this as going from maybe a confusion or an anxiety around, "I make stuff, but why is it art?".
I'll define ontology for you in one second. In quarter two, we're going to talk about how does it mean? We often have this feeling we hope that people understand our art, right? I hope that people get it. The goal is to move through that quarter and have you feel like, "Here's how my art creates meaning." have an answer to be able to articulate that. Here we'll be dealing with semiotics and communication. In Q3, we're going to be talking about where do I fit? The truth is lots of stuff has been done. Maybe everything's already been done.
So maybe there's no such thing as new. We'll talk about that a little bit today. But this focus is really on understanding our lineage and our contribution. We're going to think about originality and authorship. In Q4, we're going to talk about Why does it matter? This is a pretty big one, right? Is our work actually saying something important? Does it have value? What's its function? I want to go from that to taking you to somewhere where you can say, "Here is why my work matters." So we'll be talking about value and function.
So we have a long journey together. There's a lot to cover. Today we're focused on what am I making? Again, note there will be a toolkit that I'm going to share tomorrow. That covers a lot of this good stuff and has some activities for you to engage in your studio if you find it useful.
So, every quarter we talk about a question, but we're going to meet twice every quarter. So I've divided the two sessions by the two sort of main philosophical traditions, at least within the Western world: analytic philosophy and continental philosophy.
So the split between these two really emerged in the early 20th century. It's fundamentally a divide over method. What counts as a good philosophical question and how you go about answering it.
So analytic philosophy emphasizes precise definitions, logical analysis, clear arguments distinctions, stuff like that. The main question that it asks about any particular subject is, "What is X?" So what is art? What is a number? What is a sport, right? Whatever X you want to put in there, you can. And the goal of the analytic philosopher is to find the boundaries of that category. On the continental side, it's much more interested in lived experience, historical context, and how things actually show up for us in our lives.
So the question here is more about what does X do? So again, what does art do? What does sport do?
So on and so forth. We might want to think about this as what's at stake when we use a category. I'm going to be real with you. This distinction between analytic and continental is contested. There are some philosophers that think it is totally useless. There's real overlap between the two categories. And you're going to see that while I talk about analytic philosophy today, I'm going to bring in some continental philosophers as well. But this division between analytic and continental is something that lives within the canon.
So we can think about the first session today being focused on the analytic canon, arguments that come out of that or theories that come out of that canon. And the second session in a quarter will be focused on the continental canon. And yes. A note on the canon. Cannons have a lot of problems, right? All of those are noted. They are overwhelmingly white. Overwhelmingly European, overwhelmingly male, All of this is true. But these theories are still institutionally significant. We can't pretend like they don't exist, even if one might want to.
So for now, we're going to think about this as learning the dominant language so that we can speak it, so that we can critique it And if you want, choose something else entirely. So. Again, Note the cannons there. As I hope you'll see while I go through examples of each theory, I try to bring in some different types of voices throughout.
So today, We are focusing on the question, what am I making? This is the ontology of art and we're looking at it from the lens of the analytic tradition. The goal is to move from a sort of uncertainty to a kind of clarity about what you make being art. And what that might mean. All right, strap in. Let's go. Let's think about what ontology is. This might be a totally new word to you. And if it is, don't worry. I've introduced the topic as the ontology of art. And I'm going to do my best to try to define terms. That might not be normal to you, which is totally fine.
So ontology is the study the philosophical study of what things are. Or the study of what kinds of things exist.
So you can see here on the slide two main ontological questions. What kinds of things exist, and how should we categorize them?
So ontology is a sub-area of the philosophical discipline of metaphysics, which is a very large, broad area of philosophical study. This study of metaphysics studies the fundamental nature of reality. Alright, so it asks, what is this stuff made up of? Is it all material? Is some of it non-material? Is it mind? Is it something else? Lots and lots of metaphysical theories out there. But ontology is a subsection that asks, again, what kinds of things exist, And the Ontology of Art asks, "What is art?" what makes something art rather than something else, right? Why is the painting on your wall considered art and not just some pigment on a canvas?
And then for the analytic tradition, the question is how do we define the category of art? So... This question might seem very abstract, but I do think it is actually foundational. If you don't know what you're making How can you talk about what it means or why it matters? I think it has real consequences as well. It might affect whether your work gets shown in a gallery or a design store, or whether you're interviewed in an art magazine or a tech blog.
Right? So there's interesting categorical questions that are at play in your practice today. I hope that you keep this in mind as we move forward.
So let's introduce our four frameworks for today. I had to pair it to four, so these are some really good foundations for all of us. The first is art as imitation or representation. The second is art as aesthetic form. The third... Art as institutional recognition, and for art as open concept.
So. Again, my goal for you at the end of this is that you'll have new ways or opportunities you know, and different ways of articulating Here's what makes my work art and why.
So as I go through each of these, please know I'm sort of taking on the view I'm going to explain it in the way that I think is best. I'm going to explore it, I'm going to question it a little bit, but I'm sort of playing within each of these as we go. If you find something interesting in that, note it down, write a question, right? Each of these are tools that you can use. Okay. Let's get started. With Framework One. Art as imitation. Mimesis. This is the oldest Western definition of art. Going all the way back to ancient Greece. And for over 2,000 years, this was really the dominant answer to what made something art instead of not art. It's something that imitates or represents the world. Known as mimesis. Think representational artwork, painting, sculpture, drawing, that attempts to accurately represent or mirror the world. We're going to take a look at how this theory was worked out by both Plato and Aristotle, your bros up on the screen right now, because they're really where this comes from. We're going to start with Plato. Plato is one of the most foundational figures in Western philosophy. We're talking 4th century BCE Athens. He's really the first philosopher, at least in the Western canon, to seriously theorize about art's relationship to society and truth. He did not like art very much. He was pretty not, he was not a big fan.
So let's talk about why. We need to understand that Plato had a tiered metaphysics. Now remember, metaphysics is the theory of reality, right? What kind of stuff is out there? He had a three-tiered metaphysical theory of reality. At the very top, we have the forms. The world of forms are perfect. Eternal unchanging ideals. I'm talking. Perfect circle. Perfect concept of justice. Perfect concept of beauty. Okay?
Sounds pretty great, right? These exist in a sort of pure realm of ideas. Then we have the physical world. This is where we are all at. We are in a world of imperfect copies of the eternal ideas. Okay. Imperfect. Poppies.
And then we have art. Which is copies of imperfect copies. Let's look at an example. In the world of the forms, There is the perfect bed. The perfect bed exists in that realm, okay? The perfect bed. In our physical world, we have imperfect copies of these perfect beds. You probably have one in your house, maybe more than one. It's an imperfect copy. It's not a perfect bed, but it's like approaching it.
And then... We take a drawing of the imperfect copy of the bed.
Right? So art is at this third level. It's an imitation of an imitation. The bed is... The painting of the bed is a copy of a copy. It is twice removed. From the truth, which exists in the realm of the forms. Plato thought of this as shadows of shadows. Being a shadow is bad enough, but a shadow of a shadow not so great. He was deeply suspicious of artists for this reason. A carpenter actually knows something about beds, right?
Like makes them, how they function. But a painter doesn't really know what a bed is. A painter only knows what a copy of the bed looks like from one angle.
So, Plato thought that artists traffic in appearances and not truths. This is why Plato actually banned poets from his ideal society in the Republic. He thought they were dangerous because they made us feel strongly about things that aren't real.
Well, that's a bummer. But Aristotle, was Plato's student. And he disagreed with Plato about art.
So we can come back, we can rally here. He believes that art is in fact imitation, It is representing the world. It is mimesis. But he doesn't believe that the imitation is a deception. In fact, it's how we learn.
So human beings have an instinctive sense for imitation. From when we're children. That's how we pick up language, behavior, skills, and we take pleasure and recognition.
So you see a painting of a battle and you think, that's what war looks like. The key move is that Art doesn't just copy surfaces, it reveals universal truths through particular instances.
So, A work of art is a particular instance And through imitating the world, it teaches us universal truths. You watch a tragedy. You're seeing specific characters in a specific situation, but you're learning something about fate. Hubris, human suffering, and the limits of knowledge.
So that particular story gives you access to universal human truths. And for Aristotle, art is valuable because of this mimesis, not despite it. It's a practice of knowledge. Art can be our teacher. It's not a deception.
So art is saved. Thank you, Aristotle. Really appreciate that. The framework has really made a lot of sense throughout much of Western art history. Renaissance painting, portrait sculpture, landscape art, still life, history paintings.
Right? You point at one of these paintings, you point at the world, you see the relationship. Even if it's idealized or stylized, the representational link is still there.
So for a really long time, Maybe to this day, the artist's skill was really measured by how well they could capture reality. And, you know, we're talking perspective, anatomy, all of that. But... It does break down, doesn't it? What about abstract painting? What is a color field imitating? What is a grid representing? What about conceptual art, right? Kosuth's "One in Three Chairs" shows a physical chair, a photograph of a chair, and a dictionary definition of a chair. What's being imitated? Is it the concept of a chair? What about performance art?
Social practice, sound art, right? Many contemporary forms are not representational at all. And even when we do look at representational art, like here you see one of Francis Bacon's Screaming Popes, Sure, he's painting a figure. You can see that it's a person. You can see that it's a pope, that it's seated. But That's not realistic, right? There's something else going on there.
So what kind of representation is that? This debate about representation continues to resurface often around new technologies. Think about photography, 19th century. When photography was invented, people immediately asked, Is this art or is it just mechanical reproduction? The camera imitates perfectly. More accurately than any painter. But does that then make it art? Or does the perfect imitation actually disqualify it completely? Maybe art requires some sort of human interpretation selection, artistry, not just mechanical capture.
So photography had to really fight for its legitimacy as an art. It was one might argue, partially by developing practices that went beyond mere recording. Right, so we're talking Alfred Stieglitz made sort of soft focus painterly images. Later, photographers like Ansel Adams emphasized composition, light, the constructed nature of the image.
So photography became art. By showing that it involved artistic choices, not just pointing a camera and not just being mimesis.
So let's introduce someone who's more from that continental background but can help us think about representation today. Jacques Ranciere. He's a contemporary French philosopher. He argues that mimesis is not just about copying, or imitating. It's actually a whole regime for organizing representation, for determining what counts as a proper subject for art, and how it should be shown.
So this is taking the idea of representation and mimesis as representation a lot farther. For him, the important thing is not the copying itself, but how it establishes relationships between what's shown and what's sayable. What's visible and what's invisible. Representational regimes determine what's worth representing and how.
So this can really help us understand how abstract or non-representational work still operates within systems of visibility and meaning even if they're not copying anything in that point at the world sense. All right, let's look at some examples that might hopefully help us understand Ranciere's thinking about mimesis. One of my favorite artists, Samia Khalidi, This is really where things get interesting. Because Halaby is a Palestinian artist who's been making abstract paintings since the 1960s. Her canvases are pure color, form, geometric relationships. There's no recognizable objects. It's totally non-representational. But in the 1980s, she was one of the pioneers of digital abstract art.
Some of the earliest computer-generated abstract painting. It is extremely badass. She writes her own code to create this sort of moving, evolving color compositions. Again, completely non-representational. But she talks about her abstraction as grounded in the observation of nature.
So she's not copying nature. But she's investigating visual principles that she observes in natural phenomena.
So light, movement, growth, spatial relationships, right, all come through in her work. So she's challenging traditional regimes of representation in multiple ways. First, she's a Palestinian woman. Working in abstraction and digital media.
So she's already making visible artistic concerns and formal investigations that were excluded in the dominant Western narratives about who gets to show up and make this stuff. Her digital work from the 1980s operates in a space that wasn't at the time recognized as legitimate by institutional art discourse. She's not just making non-representational work, but she's recognizing what counts as worthy of attention in contemporary art. And now you can see her work in institutions, by the way.
So this is incredibly relevant and useful for anyone working digitally or abstractly. You might not be copying the world, But you are exploring something about the world. About perceptions, systems of perception, structure, And you might be challenging regimes of visibility about who gets to make art and what counts as important artistic work. Another example, Tara Donovan.
So she makes large-scale installations from everyday materials, thousands of plastic cups like you see here, millions of toothpicks, styrofoam pieces. She doesn't really glue or alter them that much. She will stack them, arrange them to create these massive forms. What is she imitating? What is she representing? Nothing specific. She's not representing clouds or coral or landscapes. But she is making choices based on material and composition, and those choices result in the viewer seeing representation anyway.
So people describe her installations as looking like geological formations, microscopic organisms and natural phenomena. So our brains are wired to look for representations. We are wired to map onto the things that we know.
So even when an artist isn't representing something explicitly, representation can still happen in the viewer's mind. So the question becomes, is representation in the object or is it in the act of the viewer? It's another very interesting philosophical question for you to ponder. But as an artist, we can ask, How do we play with this reality in our work? How does our representation show up? And what I want to say for your practice, you have an idea now of this theory of art as imitation or art as representation. If your work is representational, this framework gives you pretty solid historical grounding. You're a part of a 2000 plus year tradition, And the most interesting thing for you to do is to figure out what kind of representation you're working with. Is it literal? Is it interpretive? There's a lot of interesting questions there. But you have Roncier's framework to work with. What are you making visible that wasn't visible before? All right. And with that, I'm actually going to pause and leave you with that takeaway question. I'm actually going to set a timer here for three minutes and what I'd like for you to do you can take a break from listening to me which I'm sure you know we all need that and Think about this question for yourself. What are you making visible in your work that wasn't visible before? We'll set that three minute timer and let you Reflect.
All right. I hope that you had some time to absorb, think, reflect. Because we're going right in to framework number two. We're not stopping. All right?
So framework number two says that art is fundamentally about creating aesthetic experiences through formal properties. So art is actually not about what it represents. It's not about its message, but it's more about how it is made and what it does. Line, color, shape, composition, rhythm, balance. All the formal elements, That's what we're thinking about here. All right, time to bring my personal favorite in, Immanuel Kant. He is one of the most important philosophers in the Western tradition, late 18th century German thinker. He wrote about everything very systematically, knowledge, ethics, metaphysics, politics, And at the end of his life, in 1790, he actually published a book on aesthetics. And it becomes the foundation for thinking about art in terms of form rather than content.
So when you experience something aesthetically or when you experience what Kant calls beauty, you're having what he calls a disinterested pleasure. You're not asking, can I use this? Or what does it mean? Or what is it representing? You're simply contemplating the thing itself. It's pure aesthetic attention. He describes beauty as having purposiveness without purpose.
So a beautiful thing feels intentional, like it has a purpose, but its purpose is not actually for anything. It just seems perfectly as it is. With his theory here, Kant is not making a claim about what art should be, but later thinkers took these ideas and ran with them. If aesthetic experience is about contemplating form rather than use or meaning, then maybe form is what matters most in something being art. That is the move that Clive Bell and Clement Greenberg made in the 20th century.
So let's see what they had to say. Clive Bell was a British art critic, early 20th century, part of what's known as the Bloomer Group, Bloomsbury Group, excuse me, part of the Bloomer Group, the Bloomsbury Group, which was a circle of writers and artists in London that included Virginia Woolf.
So he was not a philosopher in the academic sense, but in 1914, he published a book called Art. How badass is that? Art. And it had a really big influence on how people talked about what makes something art.
So Bell takes Kant's ideas about aesthetic experience and he turns them into something called significant form. What all artworks share, he argues, is a combination of lines, colors, shapes that move us aesthetically. And that's it. That's what makes something art. And he's really radical about this. Representational content is totally irrelevant. It doesn't matter what the painting did depicts, a painting of a sunset and a painting of a Kandinsky abstraction can both have significant form or both lack it. What matters is the formal arrangement, not what's shown. This is really his view is that art is aesthetic form. If it moves you through its formal properties, it's art. In comes Clement Greenberg. He was an American art critic, probably one of the most influential of the mid-20th century. He was a big champion of abstract expressionism, Pollock, de Kooning, Rothko, and so on. And his writing really shaped how that work was understood and viewed.
So he takes Bell's formalism and pushes it even further. His argument is that Each art Sorry, every art form should pursue what's unique to it. What only that medium can do. He calls this medium specificity.
So for painting, what's unique about painting? Flatness. Painting is on a flat surface, so what modern painting should do is lean into that, emphasize the flatness, the surface, the material reality of the paint. Stop creating illusions of depth. What are you doing? That's not what painting is about. It's about flatness. All right? This was really the dominant critical framework for abstract expressionism, color field painting, and all of those artists' work were really discussed within formalist terms. How does color create space? How does scale affect perception? This is a prescriptive claim. It's not just, "This is what art is." But it's saying something more than that. This is what good art should be doing. And that's actually partially why it fell out of favor.
So think about how this can break down. In the '70s and '80s, formalism fell out of favor because critics were like, "This is too narrow." For example, formalism, it might be a part of the work, but what about the content? Kara Walker's silhouettes are formally striking, But can you really take out the whole content about American history and violence?
Right? It seems like the form and the content here are inseparable. What about politics and identity, right? If, Aesthetic experience is universal. Why did great art keep looking like white European men?
So feminist circles, critics of color pointed out that pure form conveniently ignored forms that got celebrated and what they decided which got celebrated and what got dismissed. The claim to be apolitical was itself political. Thank you. And what about art that refuses the object completely? What about a John Cage silent, you know, four minutes and 33 seconds? Or Marina Abramovic sitting in a chair for 700 hours?
And then there were Greenberg's own blind spots. He was famously hostile to pop art and Warhol. He could not account for Warhol, so Warhol had to be bad art. But when your framework can't make sense of some of the most significant art of its time, doesn't look so good for you.
So it does break down, but I do want to point out that formal concerns never disappeared. Artists still make formal decisions, and we still have aesthetic experiences.
So let's consider a contemporary example of how we might think about art as aesthetic form. So here we have Julie Mehretu. For large-scale paintings, some are 15 plus feet wide, layer, architectural drawings, abstract gesture marks, creating incredibly complex surfaces. When critics write about her work, they discuss its politics, globalization, migration, capital flows, erasure and memory. She is dealing with serious geopolitical content, but they talk about her formal qualities extensively. How does this layering create depth? How do these architectural fragments create rhythm across the canvas?
So this is really, I think her work is a wonderful example of how form and content aren't opposed. Her formal choices are a part of how the work creates meaning. And when you experience this and you have, I personally have had many aesthetic experiences with her paintings, right? You're not, Taken in by the geopolitical content first you're taken in by the experience and brought to all of this interesting concept content through the experience itself and Another example, William Forsyth, an American choreographer who spent most of his career in Germany. Running the Frankfurt Ballet. He is one of the most influential figures in contemporary dance. He came out of classical ballet, but he completely reimagined it. His work is talked about in very formalist terms. Geometries of bodies in space. How dancers create lines and volumes, architectural patterns.
I mean, just look at that image, right? It's stunning. But you watch his pieces and you get lost in the formal complexity of what these bodies are doing. But his work is conceptually rich. He's questioning ballet's hierarchies. Who leads? Who follows? Who gets to be center stage? He's messing with the relationships between dance and music, sometimes removing the music entirely. He is interrogating gender dynamics that are baked into classical forms.
So I use these two examples to make a point, which is that formalism isn't dead. It's just not sufficient on its own. You can care deeply about formal qualities and be doing other things. The form and the content aren't separate channels. They're really tangled up together. And what we've seen, again, Formalism isn't dead. We have artists that are deeply engaged in formal questions. Maybe this is you. But they're working in ways that Greenberg couldn't have anticipated.
So remember his whole argument was that painting should do what only painting can do. Sculpture should do what sculpture should do. Stay in your lane artists. But artists don't stay in their lanes. That's not what we're known for, right? Especially now we work across media, we combine practices.
So here's where I get to introduce one of my faves, Rosalind Krauss. So she was actually Greenberg's student. She was an art critic. She is an art critic. She argued that we live in what's called a post-medium condition. What does medium even mean now? Her answer is that maybe your medium isn't a material like paint or bronze or pixels. Maybe it's a practice. Maybe it's a set of concerns. She describes medium as whatever you keep doing. The recursive logic of your practice. I personally find this to be a really helpful reframe for artists working today. Your medium might not be a substance, it might be a question that you keep asking. Process that you keep returning to and a problem that you are just trying to work through.
So... Let's think about all this for your practice. If you're a painter, you probably are thinking about color, surface, how paint behaves. Those are formal decisions that matter. If you're working with video or time-based media, you're probably thinking about duration, pacing, editing, sound image relation. Formal concerns. If you're making installations, you're thinking about space, scale, Even if your work is primarily conceptual or political, you're still making formal choices that shape how people experience it.
So my question for you all is how much are you thinking about aesthetic experience when you make decisions? Are you designing for beauty, for visual interest, for formal relationships, or is it secondary to the concept, the message, or the function? Neither of these is wrong.
Right? Plenty of artists barely care about form at all.
Some are deeply devoted to it. But knowing where you are on that spectrum is going to help you understand what you do. We're going to do the thing again where we take three minutes. You get to absorb, think and reflect I have this takeaway question for you. Where do you fall on this spectrum? What would be lost if your work looked completely different but communicated the same idea. No wrong answers. I'm going to set my three minute timer here. And I'll see you on the other side.
All right. Hopefully you got some time to reflect, think about where you might be on the spectrum. Continue to think if you find this fruitful outside of the talk today. All right, framework three. Art as institutional recognition. This is a pretty juicy one. This one says that art are things that get conferred art status by the art world. This might sound circular, but it is getting at something real. The idea here is that there isn't an intrinsic property that something has that makes it art.
So it's not about representation. It's not about formal qualities. It doesn't matter. The object doesn't matter at all. The thing doesn't matter. What makes it art is that it gets treated as art. It gets shown in galleries, it gets written about by critics, it's collected by museums, it's taught in art history courses. The idea here is that art is a social category, not a natural one. It's not something that you find out in the world. It is something that's created. The art world is the institution that decides what's in, And what's out.
So to introduce this theory, I'm going to introduce Arthur Danto. He was an American philosopher and critic mid to late 20th century. He is a rare being who both published in analytic philosophy journals and an art forum. We love him. We miss him. He wrote art criticism for the nation for many years. But his big contribution really came from a single experience. In 1964, he walked into a gallery in New York and saw Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes. Then he asked a question that seems simple but turned out to be hard to answer. Why are these Brillo boxes art? When the Brillo boxes in the supermarket are not. They're visually identical. You cannot tell by looking. This is really important. Context matters. Theory matters. Art history matters. What makes something art is that it's embedded in what's known as the art world. This whole ecosystem of galleries, critics, collectors, education, art history. Without that framework, Warhol's boxes are just boxes. They're not art.
So then we go to George Dickey. He was an American philosopher who took Danto's insight and formalized it into what's called institutional theory. His argument is that art is what gets conferred art status by representatives of the art world. The art world is not a building. It's a social institution, a system. And certain people in that system have the authority to say, This is art. Who are those people? Museum directors, curators, gallery owners, collectors, art historians, MFA program directors, so on and so forth. They don't all have to agree, and in fact, sometimes they don't, but there's a network of people whose recognition matters. This is radical because it means that art isn't defined by intrinsic properties. Intrinsic properties are again qualities that belong to the object itself. Things you could point to if you were just looking at it in isolation. You could say, "That was painted with skill," or, "That moves me aesthetically." But Those were what the two first frameworks that we talked about were saying. There's intrinsic properties that an object has that makes it art. But Dickey is saying that none of these determine whether something is art. What determines it is social recognition. It gets conferred from outside the object, not a quality that lives inside it.
So I'm going to introduce Someone from more from the continental side, just let me have it. Pierre Bourdeau. He is a French sociologist and he helps explain how this actually works. He developed the concept of cultural capital and field theory. The artwork is a field, a structured social space with its own logic, its own form of value, its own gatekeepers. To succeed in the field, you need cultural capital. That's not money, right? Money is economic capital. But cultural capital is knowledge, credentials, taste, connections, the right vocabulary. Cultural Capital includes things like knowing art history, speaking the discourse, fluently showing in the right galleries you know, knowing the right critics His insight here is that taste is not natural or personal. It's socially constructed and it reinforces power structures. The people who have cultural capital are the ones who get to define Think what counts as art. This explains why institutional recognition has mattered so much. It's not just validation. It's actually access to the field, right? To the field of the art world. You need the right forms of capital to be recognized within that field. For artists what this means and it's you know if you take on this theory right Making good work just isn't enough. You need to accumulate cultural capital. You need to be fluent in discourse. This can feel cynical, but it's simply describing how this social society works. Every field has its own form of capital and its own gatekeepers. The art field is no different.
So, Duchamp proved this a century ago. Right. He took a urinal. We signed our mutt, submitted it to an exhibition. The object barely changed. It was still a journal. What made it art was the act of presenting it in an art context. We can think about something Similar, street art and graffiti.
Right? In the 70s and 80s, Graffiti was only known as being vandalism, right? It's still vandalism today, but it was only vandalism. Arrests happened, the same marks on a subway car could get you jailed. Basquiat is an interesting case. He started tagging as Sammo on the New York streets then moved into galleries and eventually became one of the most expensive artists in auction history.
So his work did change. I want to acknowledge that, right? The street tags and the paintings are not the same thing. But what's really interesting is that once institutions embraced him, they went back and conferred art status on the early street work too.
So SAMO tags are now in museum collections. The institutions reached back and legitimized what had been purely known as vandalism. The context didn't change the present, it rewrote the past.
So Andrea Fraser is a really key figure in institutional critique. And for this work that you're seeing an image of, Museum Highlights from 1989, she gave a tour of the Philadelphia Museum of Art as a fictional docent character named Jane Castleton. But. Fraser's tour treated everything in the museum as worthy of art historical analysis. Not just the paintings and the sculptures, the bathrooms, the water fountains, the museum shop, the building's architecture. And she did all of this within the vernacular of theory and the art world.
So the work asks us what makes the objects in this museum art. Is it simply the museum context itself? The institution is what creates art status.
So, Fraser showed this by treating non-art objects, like toilets and fountains, with the same sort of reverent attention that we would give to canonical artworks. So later she wrote extensively about the institutional critique and her most famous statement is that it's not a question of being against the institution, We are the institution. Artists, critics, curators, collectors, all of us together constitute the art world. You can't critique it from outside because there is no outside. This is a key insight. I think one that It is ripe for conversation and debate. Even artists who try to work outside institutions who create the art world, Frasier and the institutional theory are saying that they still operate within it. The critique gets absorbed. Pretty fun stuff.
So thinking about understanding cultural capital, I just want to think about what we do in practice. We can think about credential capital. Where do you have an MFA? Is it from Yale? Is it from RISD?
Right? Showing in certain galleries. This is institutional affiliation. Being written about. Are you written about in Art in America, Art Forum? That's critical validation.
You know how to write an artist statement using the right vocabulary. That's linguistic capital. Can you discuss your work in relationship to art history? That's knowledge capital. And do you have connection to curators and critics? That's social capital. None of these things are about the quality of the work itself. It's about accumulating the forms of capital that the art recognizes and values.
That's why diversity in institutions really matters. This is why we want to have representation of diversity throughout the art world, because those people who hold cultural capital get to make and define what good art is.
So, For your practice, this framework is strategic. If you want institutional recognition, you need to understand the field that you're trying to enter. What forms of cultural capital matter? Who are the gatekeepers? What contexts confer legitimacy?
So, I'm going to give you that three minutes. This is a heavy framework, right? There's a lot going on here. I would love to take three minutes and ask you to reflect. What institutions or contexts would confer art status on your work? Which ones do you actually care about? And what cultural capital do you need to be recognized by them? More than you can answer in three minutes, for sure. But. A good start.
All right. Three minutes. To figure out where you are in the social art field again. I urge you to take these questions into your cohort discussions, into your own practice. This is really deep stuff. And again, happy to answer more questions or talk more about it in the chat. But before then, our last framework. We've made it to framework four, art as an open concept.
So this framework says, maybe we should stop trying to define art. We keep coming up with these definitions, they keep having these problems. The first three frameworks we talked about tried to pin down what art is, Was it representation? Is it aesthetic form? Is it institutional recognition? Art as open concept says that this is just the wrong approach. Art doesn't have to have a definition. It's an open concept that keeps changing and expanding. Things count as art because they share some features with other things that we already call art, not because there's one essential property that they all have in common.
So to introduce this, I want to talk about Morris White. He was an American philosopher working heavily in aesthetics and in 1956 he wrote an essay that basically said, "Stop trying to define art. You can't do it." His argument is that art is an open concept. You can't pin it down. With what we call necessary and sufficient conditions. That's what analytic philosophers really love when you can define something with necessary and sufficient conditions. But when we try to do that with art, any definition that you come up with Some new artwork comes along and breaks the definition. There's always what we call a counter example. Art keeps changing, keeps expanding, And that is in fact its nature.
So, White borrowed this idea from Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. He was Austrian, worked mainly in Cambridge, and he basically transformed philosophy twice, which is like a massive flex, once early on in his career, and then again later when he changed his mind about everything. Highly recommend a read.
So his concept of family resemblance comes from the later work when he changed his mind. He was really interested in how language actually functions, and he noticed that we use words all the time without being able to define them properly. His example was the word "game." Think about this. Word games, chess, football, solitaire, hide-and-seek. They are all games. But, is there one property that they all share? Can we find that property and say a game is All games have this property. Turns out, there's not a single feature that unites them all. Instead, they have overlapping similarities, like members of a family who share different traits. One has mom's nose, another has dad's eyes, but there's no one feature that everyone has.
So, Weitz took this and applied it to art. He said painting, sculpture, performance, conceptual art, sound art, they're all called art because they share some features with other stuff that's called art, not because there's one essential property.
So I want to introduce Boris Groys, who's a contemporary German philosopher and art theorist. He writes for E-Flux, he's a teacher, and he's been really influential in how people think about contemporary art. He takes the idea of the open concept and asks, okay, If art, let's say art is always expanding, what drives that expansion? Maybe we can't define art, but what's its nature? We can still explore and think about it. His answer, is newness. And here's how he frames it. At any moment, there's the archive. Everything that's already recognized as valuable art and culture. The canons. Museum collections, art history books, right? Everything that is art. Then there's what he calls the trash heap. Stuff that's not yet recognized. Innovation happens when something from outside the archive gets pulled in. Here again is how he reframes it. We have the archive.
And then we have the trash heap, right? So newness is, this innovation, getting pulled into the archive from the trash heap, this is what the art world rewards. This is that sense of newness, the sense of innovation. Duchamp's urinal existed in the trash heap. It was in a plumbing store, right? It was just trash, a commodity object. He pulled it, put it in the archive. Hey, look, now it's canonical.
So, Troy's insight is that the art system needs to constantly expand and innovate to survive. It feeds on the new. Each thing that gets recognized as art expands the concept, which is exactly what White's Open concept predicts. The system needs newness. It needs to expand. Safe, familiar work doesn't expand the archive.
So for practicing artists like yourselves, ourselves, this framework can help explain why innovation matters, right? Why doing something that's already been done, even if you're doing it well, is not as valued. The system rewards newness, novelty, and expansion. But it creates pressure, right? Uncomfortability in the, if there's any truth in this, right? Being new. Is that even possible? We'll talk about someone who says it's not in a future class. Hold your horses for that one. But let's think about how this plays out in contemporary practice. Think about performance art in the 1960s and 70s. Here you see Abramovic and Ulay Aakanshi and Burden, right? When they did this work, people were like, "Is this art? Are you serious?" Right? There's no object, there's nothing to sell, there's no aesthetic form. But gradually, performance joined the art family. Why?
Well, it resembled art in some important ways. It was shown in galleries. It was discussed by critics. While it was radically new.
So in Grohe's framework, we can think performance was new to the archive. It pulled in elements from theater, ritual, endurance, and spectacle that were not in the archive beforehand. All right, so let's think about Some newer work.
So this is Hito Stierile. She is a German artist and a theorist who completely blurs categories. She makes video essays that are shown in museums and biennials. She writes theory that's produced in journals and academic texts. She could be called an artist, a filmmaker, a theorist. Is she all of them? Is she none of them?
Right? Her work joins the art family through resemblances.
So this is a still from her piece, How to Not Be Seen, a fucking didactic educational MOV file, which is just... Glorious as a title, right? What makes her work art rather than say just a smart video essay?
Right? Well, partly institutional recognition and partly that it's new within the discourse. She brought forms from outside the archive essay film academic lecture and internet aesthetics, into contemporary art.
So again, this is her most, I would argue, her most famous work. It's literally a video tutorial about becoming invisible in the digital age. It looks like a YouTube instructional video, but it's shown in museums. As art because it's positioned within our discourse and because it innovates. There's that newness within that discourse. Another example, Cameron Rowland.
So he makes work that looks like sculpture, but functions as economic and political intervention. So this is a piece from a 2016 show at Artist Space where he displayed objects. Here, a desk manufactured by prisoners at Attica. He showed oak courtroom benches, shipping container bars, all available for rent, not for purchase.
So there was a rental agreement part of the work that was really key. One piece was actually a legal document creating a trust that purchased Aetna shares to be held until the US pays reparations. Is this sculpture. Is this political organizing. Is this both, right? The objects look like ready-mades, But there's something more going on there.
Right? So the art market itself in this piece becomes the medium.
So what's happening here is the new is expanding within our discourse. What does this mean for your practice?
So the open concept is, framework gives you a lot of freedom. You don't have to fit into predefined categories. In fact, you should try not to, right? You can work across medias, combine practices, do something that doesn't look like traditional art. And what matters is that you want to think about what is new in your work. Not new to the entire world, but new within art discourse. What are you bringing into the archive that wasn't there before? What is your relationship to innovation and newness?
Right? It's a really interesting question to investigate.
So I'm going to give us those three minutes. To think about what existing art practices Does your work resemble? For later, I would say, or if you can do it now, that's great, but make a list of three to five artists, movements, or practices that your work connects to And then ask yourself what's different.
So I'm going to give you again three minutes to think and absorb.
All right. So again, three minutes, not enough time to answer these questions fully. I pass them on to you and all of the free time that you have or as a dedicated part of your studio practice.
Well, we survived through four frameworks. We talked about art as imitation and representation. We talked about art as aesthetic form. Art as institutional recognition, and art as open concept. I want to emphasize again, For you as an artist, I don't want you to take these away as necessarily competing truths where you have to pick one. If you want to do that, that's fine. But I think they're much more interesting as different tools, right? You might be making work that's representational, that creates aesthetic experience through form, that needs institutional recognition, and expands the art field through newness. That's totally possible, right? And understanding where that happens is really interesting and an important part of your practice.
So again, I hope that through All this stuff I shared that you were able to move a little bit closer to I know why my what I make is art. I know why it's art and I know why that matters. I hope you're a little bit closer. I'm really excited to talk next class. We're going to talk about the same sort of topic or the same sort of question, but really from that continental tradition lens.
So we'll be coming back together in five weeks, which I'm already excited about. I hope you are too. But I want to take the remainder of our time to see if you have any questions, any thoughts. Again, I'm happy to answer the best of my ability. And yeah, let's open it up.
Haiver â € | 01:16:55
I want to start with a question Amy Goodchild had quite a bit ago. So when talking about a perfect bed, so this is going back to Plato and the idea of imitating these ideal forms, Amy asked, When talking about a perfect bed as an idea or form, is that like perfect as in great sheets, clean, warm, cozy, etc. Or is it more like perfect as in accurately or purely a bed and nothing else?
Rebecca Millsop | 01:17:25
Excellent question. Plato is definitely thinking about it in that latter way, in that sort of complete, pure, undiluted nature of bed.
Right? So you can think about the forms. If you could strip away Everything that's accidental or particular about every bed that's ever existed is Right? And get to the sort of underlying bedness of beds, that's the form, right? It's ideal. It exists in its pure bedness. And everything that is the sort of, that is a property that we interact with in the world is an incomplete form of something in that way.
So like you, I think you said one of it was like cozy sheets, right? So like there's a, like what is the form of a sheet, right? It's like there's a perfect, undiluted, you strip away everything accidental about the concept of a sheet. There's a form of a sheet that exists up in that realm. Up. Around wherever it exists. I hope that helps.
So yeah, the second way.
Haiver â € | 01:18:40
Yeah, Amy replied, that makes sense. Thank you. I hope it was more about bedness than niceness, but wasn't sure.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:18:48
I mean, I'm all about a cozy bed. Don't get me wrong, but... Bye.
Haiver â € | 01:18:53
I feel like when I first started encountering art in relation to philosophy, like I heard goodness, beauty and truth came up a lot. And so like capital T truth wasn't a thing that I like we talked a little bit about ideal forms here, but we quickly moved on to aesthetic experience. And I'm curious why that was or how that fits into the way you think about art.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:19:30
Try really hard to play around with this idea of capital T business. Truth, capital B, Beauty, right? But when we try to get really strict with those things, we run into a lot of counterexamples and we run into a lot of problems because the world and these concepts that we're playing around with are much messier than... Plato would maybe like them to be. At least that's my personal opinion. I am definitely on the open concept side of things. It's one of the things that I actually wrote my dissertation on in graduate school.
So I think It's interesting to think abstractly in that way and you can really dive in and you can think about the ideal forms But then we want to ask ourselves as an artist, what are we doing with that? Maybe you really feel like you are like creating something that's related to the ideal forms, I think that would be super rad. I think that's a really interesting way to have a practice.
Haiver â € | 01:20:32
Yeah, I mean the only time I think I've seen the ideal form is like a teacher who's really good at drawing the perfect circle on a chalkboard by like...
Rebecca Millsop | 01:20:39
It's a like... Exactly. That's as close as we got.
Haiver â € | 01:20:47
So I'm curious, like Clement Greenberg, like famously like a curmudgeon. First, like, seems so appealing the first time you read him, you get excited about the ideas of formalism and saying, okay, this is the medium I'm working in.
So how do I make this medium the most like take advantage of exactly what this medium was designed for. How do I make my sculpture the most 3D and the use of space that it's doing? But then when I look at like Rauschenberg's on a wall, which is like assemblage, it's not sculpture on a pedestal and it's not, it has paint in it, but it's not flat, which is what Greenberg said made painting great. The structural questions really start to break down very quickly between those mediums. I'm curious, what do you think Plato would have thought of Clement Greenberg's formalism?
Rebecca Millsop | 01:21:39
Ugh. I mean, first of all, Again, Plato was like not, he did not like artists, right?
Like he would be like shut this whole thing down. Like what are you doing? This is a disaster.
I mean, I think he definitely thinks that about what the world is like in general right now. I think that he would probably, you know, he would say that Greenberg is, Trying to sort of profit off of the lie of artists accessing truth, right? Because Greenberg is like, we're getting at something pure with flatness of painting. You look at a Frankenthaler painting and you're like, that, I think Plato would say like, no, flatness has nothing to do with that. Flatness is Let me remind you, there is in fact a pure ideal form of flatness and painting is so far from it. I think that that's where he would go.
I mean, I think it's interesting because maybe Greenberg would come back and say, but look, I'm actually, this is actually not imitating, right? This is, or this is actually imitating. This is getting at flatness. But I think... I still think that Plato would, think that he was lying to us. That's my, that's, but I think that's a great question. I think Greenberg felt like he was getting at something very similar though.
Haiver â € | 01:23:01
Yeah, the pureness of the thing itself, which is, as soon as we say that word, I get very worried because the art world is inherently messy.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:23:09
Exactly. That's a great question.
Haiver â € | 01:23:12
I mean, so same question, but Aristotle and Clive Bell then. I feel like there's a nice little relationship going on at the house.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:23:19
I love that, actually. That's a great connection. I feel like, yeah, I definitely feel like Clive Bell is much more interesting, is much more of a pedagogue, like is interested in utilizing significant form in a, in an expansive way, whereas I do feel like Greenberg is like, very disciplinary in their Plato way.
So, yeah, I think that's a really interesting connection that I want to explore more. I think that I'll leave it with that and let everyone else jump into their own research around this as well. I love that connection.
Haiver â € | 01:23:58
Yeah, I mean, one thing you said about Bell that really resonated with me was, if it moves you through its aesthetic forms, then it's art, which leaves this inverse position, though, that what happens, right, if we look at a work and it doesn't move you? Are we now saying, at least if we see this as a philosophical question, We're now saying it's not ours?
Rebecca Millsop | 01:24:19
This is wonderful and actually takes me back to Kant, who was again the originator of this framework. So one of the things that Kant says about having an aesthetic experience is that when you have the aesthetic experience, it is a, like you experience it as universally aesthetic. But it is a subjective thing objective experience. It's fascinating because when you find something to be, when something moves you like really aesthetically pleasing, you're like, everyone should have the same experience.
Like, how could anyone who has a brain and eyes like mine look at this, whatever, Motherwell painting and not like, just explode with joy or whatever emotion, right? So Kant actually thinks that's a part of what makes an experience an aesthetic experience is the sense of it being universally accepted. Even though you know others won't.
So on the... Flip side, of course, if you don't have an aesthetic experience with a work of art, I think there's a... I think that... If you take this theory very seriously, you can ask yourself, well, then what makes it art? Is it just because someone else had an aesthetic experience with it? Is that what defines the category? Different philosophers take different tacks on this question, but it is a really fabulous one.
Haiver â € | 01:25:48
So a couple of questions from the chat here as we're wrapping up. OK. We have one here about, what would you say that as our culture evolves, the layering as the art definition will grow.
So I feel like that's both an observation and a question, right? Is the definition going to continue to grow as we continue to layer?
Rebecca Millsop | 01:26:09
Well, I leave this all to you, be an artist, to see what you create. And I think it depends on which framework you want to create. What framework you're putting on. If you put on the open concept framework and you're sort of agreeing with Weitz and you're agreeing with Greuze, you're taking on Wittgenstein, then yes, it has to. It's like by its nature, the concept and the definition of art will continue to change. If you take on one more rigidly, you're going to have to put on some battle guards to keep things at bay.
Haiver â € | 01:26:45
One other in here. So speaking about intrinsic factors of art shouldn't go beyond just the object, but the feeling thoughts and design.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:26:57
Of the artist. Is that what you said? Yes, the artist's intention. We will return to this. Definitely a very important quality that many philosophers have argued is necessary. I think it's that you can go in different directions. And when we talk about authorship and lineage, we will discuss this point in more detail.
So I'll leave it for that.
Haiver â € | 01:27:23
Okay, great. I really appreciate that you structured the talk in a lot of ways talking about both the formal and aesthetic qualities in the first half, but talking about the social and cultural aspects in the second half, that it's not possible to separate the two, certainly not in the contemporary era.
Rebecca Millsop | 01:27:45
Yes, I mean, this is just, this comes from my lived experience of trying to live in the world of ideals in a way, right? Like living in the world of analytic philosophy while being an artist and always feeling these tensions. I think we were actually talking about a while back having a conversation around reading analytic, certain analytic philosophers about art.
Like they only use Guernica as like their example. Like they only use Guernica.
Like there's only one painting that exists and it's Guernica. Yeah.
So I think, you know, these are questions that are very real and alive in our studios and when we go experience art and, you know, they're very important to me and I appreciate believe everyone that's here. So, you know, We got to dig in. We got to dig into the mess.
Haiver â € | 01:28:39
Yeah. I mean, last question.
So you talked a little bit about things off of the trash heap and the fact that the outsider is still within the art world. But you talked about capital and not just financial capital, right, but social and cultural capital, knowledge capital, institutional capital. And I'm curious how the What would you say to an artist who doesn't want to play that game, doesn't want to write the artist's statement in a particular language that makes them legible to a specific group of people in the art world, or doesn't want to go schmooze in certain rooms because they're an introvert and they like being in their studio, or it's simply not possible for them? But how does that fit into the whole of the story?
Rebecca Millsop | 01:29:30
Yeah, so what I'm hearing you say is like, how do we both take on the institutional framework and the open concept framework at the same time, right? How do we embody both of those? I think it's really fascinating and I think that, right, this is why I asked the takeaway questions I asked because you can decide if you actually care about having your work seen in certain places, right? You get to make that decision. If you do care about it being seen in certain places, well, then you got to play the game and do the stuff. But maybe... In bucking that, you end up bringing something out of the trash heap that becomes recognized through the art institution in some other way, right? It's not cookie cutter, you know, like this has to be like this or it has to be like this, right? It's very interesting.
I mean, there's plenty of outsider artists that we can talk about. Henry Darger, for example, right? Who's like actually just never was a part of the art world, but now is very much a part of the art world. And in part because it pushed the boundaries, right? It really pushed the boundaries in some interesting ways.
So I think we're just very, as human beings, there's something about our nature that's at play here. Why do we want this sense of newness? Why are some of us drawn to be artists? Why do some artists want to push, buck the system? All of that is really healthy, to being human beings. And it's interesting to see how the contradictions can coexist.
Haiver â € | 01:31:08
Fantastic. Well, thank you so much for this incredible talk and for kicking off what will be an amazing four quarters of digging into how this fits with our studio practice.
So we will see you in a few weeks, and Rebecca will be in the chat with us. So any questions we didn't get to, please drop them in. The replay will be out in the next day or so feel free to go back and rewatch any sections that would be useful to you. And there was one question we got from Michael about recommended readings and where to go from here, which I know you will be very game for, so I'm excited for it.
Yeah, exactly. Engage dance mode. All right. We will see you all soon and have a good day all.
