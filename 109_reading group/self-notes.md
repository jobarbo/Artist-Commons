The sens of seeing comes before words, meaning we see before we can speak.

The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. We explain our words with words but these words and the worded explanation never really fits the sight (ie, a sunset).

The surrealist painter Magritte explored on this gap between words and the seeing in a painting called "The Key of dreams"

The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe.

- ie: When, in the middle ages, people believed in the physical existence of hell, the simple sight of fire must have meant something different from what it would means in today's time.

The feeling of being loved has a completeness which no words can match.

We only see what we look at, so seeing is an act of choice.

We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves.

Soon after we can see, we are aware that we can also be seen. The eye of the other combines with our own eye to make it fully credible that we are a part of this visible world.

"all images are man made."

Every imaged embodies a way of seeing. Even a photographs. The photographers way of seeing is reflected in his choice of subject.

The painters way of seeing is recontitured by the marks he makes on the canvas or paper.

Our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seing.

The more imaginative a work is, the more profoundly it allows us to share the artist's experience of the visible

When an image is presented as a work of art, the way people look at it is affected by a whole series of learnt assumptions about art, like:

- Beauty
- Truth
- Genius
- Civilization
- Form
- Status
- Taste
- etc.

Fear of the present leads to mystification of the past.Cultural mystification of the past entails a double loss.

When we "see" a landscape, we situate ourselves in it. If we "saw" the art of the past, we would situate ourselves in history.

When institutions or experts block that direct seeing, they also block our access to our own history. Berger asks: who gains from that? His answer is that elites benefit by turning the past into a foggy, “mystified” story that makes their power look inevitable or noble. But in the modern world, that story no longer holds up, so it has to be wrapped in mystification to keep working.

Hals painting of Governors and Governesses:

- Context he gives: Hals is an old, poor man, living on public charity. He paints wealthy administrators of that same charity. That social tension is real and visible in the portraits.
- What the historian does: He says we shouldn’t read any criticism into the paintings and then praises formal qualities (composition, blacks/whites, harmony).
- Berger’s complaint: That kind of language turns the painting into a purely aesthetic object. It shifts the emotional charge away from the lived social conflict (poverty vs. power) and into “disinterested appreciation.”
- Result: The paintings become about the “human condition” in general, and the specific historical tension disappears.
- Berger’s push: Even if we can’t prove Hals’s intentions, the paintings themselves are evidence of a real relationship—poor painter looking at powerful patrons. We should look at that evidence and judge, rather than accept the neutralizing art-historian framing.

Berger says the critic is “mystifying” the work by smoothing out social conflict into formal beauty.

- The paintings “work on us” because we accept Hals’s way of seeing the sitters.
- We accept it not innocently, but because it matches how we already read people, gestures, and institutions.
- That match is possible because our society still has similar power relations and moral values to Hals’s time.
- So the urgency of the paintings comes from social recognition, not just Hals’s technique.

the real tension in Hals’s portraits comes from the social gap: the poor, disgraced painter is looking at wealthy charity officials, while trying to paint them “objectively” despite his own hardship. That clash—the unequal relationship between sitter and painter—is the “drama” and the “unforgettable contrast.”

A “pauper” is a very poor person, often someone who depends on public charity for basic survival.

If we can see the present clearly enough, we shall ask the right questions of the past.

Mystification has little to do with the vocabulary used. Mystification is the process of explaining away what might otherwise be evident.

Today we see the art of the past in a different way.

Renaissance perspective assumes a single, fixed viewer. The painting is built as if all lines converge on one eye, making that viewer the “center” of the scene—like God at the center of the universe. That system implies a stable, authoritative viewpoint.

humans aren’t God: we can only stand in one place at one time. Once photography (and later film) appeared, it became obvious that vision is mobile and tied to time and position. Cameras can move, zoom, cut, and show many angles, revealing that there’s no single, privileged viewpoint. That’s the “contradiction”

he camera isolated
momentary appearances and in so doing destroyed the idea
that images were timeless.

photography (and especially film) made people newly aware that seeing is time‑bound, position‑bound, and constantly changing. That shift nudged painters to stop treating vision as one stable, God‑like viewpoint.

- Impressionists: The camera “freezes” a fleeting instant. That encouraged painters to chase the momentary, shifting effects of light, weather, and movement. So instead of timeless, carefully constructed scenes, they painted quick, fugitive impressions—what the eye catches right now.
- Cubists: Film can show multiple angles and moments; it breaks the idea of a single fixed viewpoint. Cubists pushed that further by showing many viewpoints at once on a single canvas. Instead of one “correct” perspective, they assembled a total experience of an object from multiple positions.

Impressionism responds by painting the instant, and Cubism responds by painting the many viewpoints.

Before the camera, a painting "belonged to a place". It's meaning tied to the physical setting, context and the ritual of being there.

Reproduction through camera breaks that bond. It no longer has one fixed context, so it's meaning splinters into many different meanings depending on where and how people see it.(on TV, in a book, at home, etc).

The uniqueness of a work is now not about what it shows but aboutbeing THE OG behind all those copies.

That shift invites Mystification. Why? Because the original is so rare and expensive, people trat it like a sacred relic.

The art world focuses on provenance, ownership and authenticity(Is it really a leonardo, who commissioned it, who owns it (now and past))

So the viewer’s experience changes. You may feel awe at the original because it’s the “real one,” not because of its visual or emotional message.

Berger says that’s a culturally manufactured kind of reverence.

The virgin by leonardo became impressive, not becaus of what it shows or the meaning behind the image but because it has become mysterious and impressive because of it's MARKET value.

If the image is no longer unique and exclusive, the art object, the thing, must be made mysteriously so.

The majority of the population do not visit art museums. The following table shows how closely an interest in art is related to privileged education.

- “Bogus religiosity” means the art world treats originals like sacred relics—reverent, untouchable, full of aura—but that reverence is not spiritual in a real sense. It’s built on rarity and market price.
- Why? Once art becomes reproducible, the original loses its old unique authority. To compensate this, culture invents a new kind of "holy status" for the object itself.
- "Nostalgic function" means this reverence is looking backward. It's trying to preserve the old elitist prestige of art even though mass reproduction has changed everything
- This fake aura helps keep art aligned with elite power ans wealth rather than shared publicly.

- Reproduced art becomes information that can be cropped, repurposed, arrated and surrounded by text.
- Meaning it's meaning is not fixed. it shifts based on contecxt
- So reproduction is not just about accuracy, it's about new uses new arguments new contexts.
- The boards and posters example: is berger model for a new way of using images: personal, mixed and alive. All images sit on the same plane because they're chosen for your life and not for "high art" status.
- The function of museums as elite,sacred spaces could be replace by a more personal, democratic image language.
- Originals still matters,but the ritualized authority approach associated with them needs to change.
- The meaning of art shouldn't be controlled by experts or eliste. it should belong to people who connect it to their lives and history.
- Images are everywhere now. the political question is: who gets to use this new language of image, and for what purpose?
