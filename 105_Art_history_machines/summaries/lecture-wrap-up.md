## 🎯 Core Concept

This lecture traces a **conceptual history of "optical orders"**—how different eras construct different logics of seeing. Rather than following a strict timeline, it explores how vision operates, what consequences arise, and what possibilities emerge when technology transforms how we see.

**Key Insight:** Seeing is not a biological act—it's cultural. Every era has its own **optical order** that defines how we see and what counts as real.

## 📐 Part 1: The View From Above - Perspective as Power

### The Renaissance Revolution (1420)

**Filippo Brunelleschi** demonstrated linear perspective—a mathematical system where all lines converge to a vanishing point. His experiment:

- Painted Florence Baptistery in perfect perspective
- Drilled a peephole at the vanishing point
- Viewed the panel's reflection in a mirror
- The painted image emerged seamlessly with reality

**Modern Parallels:** Viewfinder, camera, VR headset, camera obscura, photography, 3D scanners

### What Perspective Changed

**Human Position:** The viewer was placed at the center of vision. Space became measurable, ownable, navigable.

**Power Dynamics:** When land could be represented geometrically, it could be:

- Divided
- Taxed
- Sold
- Colonized

**Leonardo da Vinci's Imola Map (1502):** Unlike medieval maps centered on symbolic meaning, this used strict bird's-eye view. Commissioned by Cesare Borgia not to admire space, but to **control it**.

### The View From Above and Empathy

**What does viewing from above do to empathy?**

- Minimizes it
- Creates feeling of being surveyed/controlled
- Turns the world into abstraction

**Heidegger's Critique:** Modern humans no longer encounter things as beings—they see them as resources. Forests become timber inventory, rivers become hydropower. **Vision becomes a tool for capitalism.**

### Contemporary Artists Responding

**Andreas Gursky:** Adopts the elevated, impossible viewpoint of contemporary power itself

- Captures stock exchanges, factories, hotels, supermarkets from heights no human body could naturally reach
- Reveals capitalistic logic: sees masses, not individuals—interchangeable data points
- **Warhol's insight:** The most effective way to disturb a system is to enter it and exaggerate it from within

**Mark Lombardi:** Hand-drawn diagrams of political and financial networks

- Exposes connections the powerful want hidden
- **Visibility becomes a political weapon**
- While Renaissance maps hid uncertainties with cartouches or sea monsters, Lombardi draws to expose

**Cubism's Challenge:** Fractured perspective, showing objects from multiple angles at once

- Later inspired **dazzle camouflage** in WWI—a theory of vision became a tactic of invisibility

**David Hockney:** Photo collages stitch together multiple viewpoints and moments

- Rejected "tyranny of single point perspective"
- **"Perspective is not a natural law, it is a choice"**

**Key Takeaway:** Seeing is never neutral. Linear perspective reorganized the world into something measurable, ownable, governable. Artists respond by mimicking power's viewpoints to expose the logic.

## 📷 Part 2: The Mechanical Eye - Photography and the Optical Unconscious

### The Horse's Secret (1879)

**Eadweard Muybridge's Bet:** During a horse gallop, do all four hooves ever leave the ground?

- Lined up cameras with trip wires
- Film revealed what no human eye had seen: the horse floating mid-air
- **From that moment on, machines know more about reality than we do**

**Reactions:**

- Painter Paul Delaroche: "From today painting is dead"
- Poet Charles Baudelaire: Photography is "refuge of failed painters"
- The public: **Enchanted**—photography democratized visibility

### The Optical Unconscious

**Dziga Vertov's "Kino-eye":** The camera's mechanical eye was more perfect than the human eye

**Walter Benjamin's "Optical Unconscious":** Just as Freud revealed unconscious desires driving behavior, the camera exposed unconscious structures within vision

**Artists Expanding Vision:**

- **Man Ray:** Placed objects directly on light-sensitive paper (rayographs)—toothbrush becomes spectral silhouette
- **Harold Edgerton:** Stroboscopic flash froze events faster than perception (bullet piercing glass, milk crown)
- **Michael Wesely:** Open shutter for _years_—buildings rise and vanish in a single frame
- **Karl Strover (1926):** Micrographs—attached cameras to microscopes, captured diatoms and atoms
- **Ahmed Mater:** Overlaid hospital X-rays with Islamic illumination and prayer—medical truth meets spiritual invocation
- **Trevor Paglen:** Photographs unseen surveillance architecture (secret satellite bases, undersea cables)—uses telescopic lenses to capture "stars" that are actually machines watching the planet

**Key Instruments:** Microscopes, telescopes, kaleidoscopes, X-rays, aerial photography, infrared, radio waves—all extensions of the photographic principle

## 👻 Part 3: Photography and Death - The Paradox of the Image

### Roland Barthes: Photography as Paradox

Every photograph says: **"Here it is" AND "This has been"**

- Every photo is a tiny time machine
- The essence of photography is **death**—a record of a moment that no longer exists
- Photos of the dead (or living) feel ghostly

**19th Century Literal:** Families posed deceased children for post-mortem photographs—mechanical images began to replace lived memory

### The Overload Problem

**Erik Kessels - _24 Hours in Photos_ (2007):** Printed 350,000 images uploaded to Flickr in a single day, poured them into a gallery as a mountain

- **We're no longer remembering—we're drowning in memory**
- Photography's promise to preserve everything collapses into overload
- **Nietzsche's warning:** Too much memory is sickness

**Joachim Schmid:** Urges us to _stop taking pictures_

- Produces no new photographs
- Collects abandoned snapshots from flea markets, family albums, hard drives
- Reorganizes them into typologies (people holding cats, people in front of cars)
- Private memory becomes repeatable pattern—**life becomes a data set**

---

## 📺 Part 4: Society of the Spectacle - When Images Become Events

### Guy Debord's Insight

"Everything that was directly lived has moved away into representation"

- History becomes what is photographed
- **The image no longer records the event—the image IS the event**

**1898 Example:** Photographers bribed their way into Otto von Bismarck's death chamber. Images circulated through newspapers, reaching mourning crowds who had never been present in life. The photograph didn't merely record history—**it manufactured a historical event**.

### Contemporary Fabrications

**The Yes Men:** Impersonate corporate spokesmen, broadcast fake news reports announcing outrageous policies

- Audiences believed it because **the format was authoritative**
- In mass media, **legitimacy belongs to the frame, not the message**

**Thomas Demand:**

1. Takes low-res media photo of charged event
2. Reconstructs every surface from paper/cardboard at life-size
3. Photographs this model in high resolution
4. Destroys the model

- Triple mediation: event → news image → paper replica → pristine print
- No original space remains, only representation that replaces what it depicts

**Richard Prince - Marlboro Man:** Rephotographed cigarette ads

- Not about cigarettes—about mythology of masculinity, frontier freedom, solitary heroism
- Images sell identity, not products

**Baudrillard's "Simulacra":** A world where copies no longer refer to originals—reality is completely replaced by representation

---

## 🎬 Part 5: Montage - Controlling Sequence, Controlling Reality

### The Authority of Format

**Orson Welles - _War of the Worlds_ (1938):** Radio broadcast of fictional alien invasion in tone of live news

- Panic spread not because story was convincing, but because **format was**
- In mass media, credibility lies in the voice of transmission

### Eisenstein's Intellectual Montage

"Collision of images manufactures thought"

- One shot doesn't simply follow another—it transforms it
- Meaning emerges **in the space between images**
- Example: _Battleship Potemkin_ Odessa Steps—no single shot can be interpreted alone

**Key Revelation:** When we watch film editing, it feels natural. We don't perceive we're being manipulated. We think **we** assemble the story correctly.

### The Narrative Imperative

**Christian Marclay - _The Clock_ (2010):** 24-hour video of thousands of film clips featuring clocks

- Every minute on screen = real time in gallery
- No plot, no storyline, no characters
- **Yet audiences anticipate what comes next and search for emotional continuity**

**Core Discovery:** "We cannot tolerate randomness—we turn it into meaning"

- Narrative is not only constructed by filmmakers
- It's **produced by the viewer's mind itself**
- No such thing as truly plotless film—our mind insists on creating one

**Andy Warhol - _Empire_ (1964):** 8-hour static shot of Empire State Building

- No plot, no action, no montage
- Yet audience waits for something
- **Suspense emerges where there is no story**
- Exposes our dependency: we need events to justify attention

## 📺 Part 6: Television - The Living Room Ideology Machine

### The Scale of Penetration

- 1953: 2/3 of American households owned TV
- 1960s: Almost 90%
- Average viewer: Hours every day in front of screen

**Susan Sontag (1977):** The rise of **"aesthetic consumerism"**—people need reality confirmed and experience intensified through images. To live increasingly meant to consume life photographically.

### Early Video Artists Fight Back

**Sony Portapak (1975):** First affordable handheld video camera—artists could record and display without film laboratories or broadcast studios

**Nam June Paik:** Treated television as both toy and weapon

- **Magnet TV:** Placed powerful magnet on working TV—picture warped, collapsed into abstract currents. Evening news dissolved into pure signal. Revealed: what appeared authoritative was fragile electronic code
- **TV Buddha:** Bronze Buddha watches itself watching itself in infinite loop—enlightenment caught in endless self-observation
- **Electronic Superhighway:** Hundreds of monitors map the United States—information becomes noise

**Wolf Vostell:** "Television is the sculpture of the 20th century"

- Embedded live monitors into canvases, metal, concrete
- Dragged TV out of living room into museum
- At home TV feels natural; in gallery it becomes strange and physical

### Who Is The Product?

**Answer:** The viewer

**Richard Serra - _Television Delivers People_ (1973):** White text scrolling on blue screen with elevator music

- "Television does not deliver programs to audiences. It delivers audiences to advertisers."
- Removing all visuals reveals the economic structure beneath the screen

### Artists Hijacking the Medium

**Douglas Davis - _The Last Nine Minutes_ (1977):** Addresses viewers directly through screen as if private conversation

- You feel seen but cannot respond
- **Paradox:** Simulates connection while keeping viewers isolated

**Dara Birnbaum - _Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman_ (1978-79):** Cheerful commercials for facial tissues alternate rapidly with war/violence footage

- Tragedy and consumption become interchangeable units
- **TV's most dangerous trick:** Not censorship, but emotional leveling

**Chris Burden - _TV Hijack_ (1972):** Storms live broadcast studio

- Shows broadcast authority is fragile, can be interrupted physically

**Paper Tiger TV:** Built low-budget pirate programs dissecting mainstream news

- Used television to explain how television works

**Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe:** Produced fake Soviet TV broadcasts perfectly mimicking official state media but with absurd, surreal, subversive content

- **Power lies less in what is said than how it's packaged**

**Media Burn:** Staged performances where car literally crashed into wall of TVs

- Not metaphor—literal physical confrontation

**Marshall McLuhan:** "The medium is the message"—media are not simply channels, they are environments that shape perception

**Key Takeaway:** Images stopped documenting events and began producing them. Montage, broadcast, and mass media revealed: **whoever controls image sequence controls attention, thus controls reality**.

## 💻 Part 7: Digital Logic - When Images Become Data

### Nancy Burson - The Calculated Face (1980s)

Pioneered digital morphing:

- Scanned faces with digitizer, translated portraits into numerical coordinates
- Computer distorted first face to match second, blending them
- **Not photographed, not painted—calculated**
- Co-created first patented facial morphing software (later adopted by FBI)

**Warhead 1:** Merged faces of Reagan, Brezhnev, Mitterrand, Thatcher
**2018 Time Magazine:** Merged Trump and Putin

**Result:** Human face becomes data set. Identity becomes something that can be computed, modified, generated—**no longer bound to a body**.

### Lev Manovich's Database Logic

Once photography showed reality can be frozen, cinema taught reality can be assembled through montage. **What does digital media do?**

Images are no longer fixed frames—they are **modular units** (pixels, files, data sets) that can be stored, sorted, searched, recombined, generated.

**Database logic:** Meaning no longer arises from linear storytelling but from structure, correlation, accumulation, algorithmic recombination

### Manovich's Five Principles

1. **Numerical Representation:** Digital images are made of numbers
2. **Modularity:** Digital elements remain independent building blocks (clips, pixels, files can be rearranged without destroying whole)
3. **Automation:** Software can operate on images automatically
4. **Variability:** No digital image has singular form—can be resized, recolored, recompressed, regenerated endlessly
5. **Transcoding:** Images exist simultaneously as visual culture AND computer data

### Artists Working with These Principles

**Dan Sandin - Sandin Image Processor (1971-74):** Analog video computer

- "Video equivalent of Moog synthesizer"
- Accepts video signals, modulates them through voltage/oscillation/feedback
- Refused to patent it—distributed schematics so others could build their own

**Steina & Woody Vasulka - Rutt Etra Video Synthesizer:** Treated TV signal as raw material

- **Violin Power:** Steina plays violin—sound feeds directly into video synthesizer. Her bow strokes control the image. She's not accompanying an image, **she's playing it directly**

**Ture Sjölander - Swedish Monument (1960s):** Hijacked Swedish TV, converting film to video signals mid-transfer

- Chaplin melts, sculptures stretch, leaders dissolve
- Cultural monuments infected by electronic disease

**Max Almy - _Leaving the 20th Century_ (1982):** Three-part narrative using computer graphics

- **Countdown:** Man receives daily input directly into head through TV signals
- **Departure:** Woman leaves because nothing good on television, but wanders lost without screen
- **Arrival:** Figures trapped in digital void of failed transmissions
- Bodies float like detached objects—proto-database where humans are searchable, non-interactive fragments

**Lev Manovich - _Soft Cinema_:** Builds database of video clips, images, text, soundtracks

- Software assembles film in real time following compositional rules + controlled randomness
- "Semi-automatic film jockey"—**cinema that performs itself**
- Every screening produces different constellation—film never repeats

**Cory Arcangel - _Super Mario Clouds_ (2002):** Hacked Super Mario Brothers cartridge

- Erased all sound/visual elements except scrolling blue sky with pixel clouds
- Game still runs but nothing happens
- Isolates single graphic module, reveals hidden construction
- **Code becomes landscape**

**Key Takeaway:** Images are no longer visible things communicating content. They are modular elements that can be stored, sorted, recombined, generated. Meaning emerges from structure, correlation, permutation. **The image is no longer something we look at—it's something that runs.**

## 🎯 Conclusion: The Evolution of Vision

### Historical Progression

1. **Renaissance:** Vision became measurement—to see is to possess. Human observer at center of world
2. **Mechanical Eye:** Machines revealed what human eye cannot see. Reality expanded but slipped out of our hands
3. **Memory & Archive:** Images began to remember. Past left our minds, entered archives/screens/networks
4. **Spectacle:** Images stopped recording events, began producing them—shaping story, beliefs, identities
5. **Data:** Images became modular, generative, automated—no longer singular story, don't need single author

### Present State

**Seeing is no longer passive act. Seeing is:**

- An operation
- A computation
- A selection
- A targeting

**The Task of Artists Today:** Not simply to produce images, but to **interrupt the regimes of vision that produce us**

## 📚 Essential Insight

**The fundamental challenge:** If we believe nothing new can be created, we are done as artists. We need art history to search for **unfinished experiments**—to continue what hasn't been completed yet, to develop what can be different.

Vision has always been shaped by technology and power. Artists' role is to expose these regimes, hijack these systems, and reveal new ways of seeing that resist being reduced to control, consumption, or computation.
