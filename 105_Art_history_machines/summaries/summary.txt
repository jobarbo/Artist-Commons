Summary:

Polina framed the lecture as a conceptual history of “optical orders,” tracking how different eras build different logics of seeing, rather than following a strict timeline.

She linked mapping and the elevated viewpoint to modern power structures, then showed how artists such as Gursky and Lombardi adopt and exaggerate these visual logics to expose hidden systems and networks.

Photography and film extend perception beyond the limits of the human eye, from Muybridge’s motion studies to Vertov and Benjamin’s “optical unconscious,” reshaping what counts as visible and true.

She moved from mass media and spectacle to digital modularity, where images become datasets and programmable matter (Manovich), concluding that seeing now operates as computation, selection, and targeting.
