# 105 Art History - Machines: Learn to see

## Every era has its own optical order

In the Renaissance The world became a calculable space (what, who pushed this shift? )
-Filippo Brunelleschi demonstrated linear perspective ( use of vanishing point giving the illusion of 3d)

- Does this technique has a homologue in today technology? (3d sanner, viewfinder, vr headset),
- Linear perspective did not only change art but change the position of the human subject.
  - The universe became divisible, framea ble, organizable
  - became the view of power
  - Da vinci 1502 map of Imola, precursor to satellite imagerie
    - Used by the borgia as surveillance, skewed the empathy because the perspective transform us as "less than"
    - Modern cities are also foten created from above, ignoring how people lives in the street
  - Modern humans no longer encounter things as beings, but as resources: forests become timber inventory, rivers become hydropower, a mountain becomes something you can grid, then mine. (Martin Heidegger)
  - Vision becomes a tool for capitalism

- Artist Adres gursky explores this by creating impossible viewpoint by representing stock exchange (ie) from heights viewpoint
- The best way to disturb a system is not to resist it from the outside by saying its not correct but to enter it and exagerrate it from within
- The powerful dont want to be seen and visibility can be a political weapon.
- See Lombardi works as example (political structures and maps.)

**Cubism**

- Cubism is an experiment in vision.
- Where does the cubism experiment ended up?
  - It was used a lot in advertising but also propaganda.
  - It's patterns was also used in military camouflage and invisibility.
- David Hockney rejected the tiranny of single-point perspective
  - Says our perspective Is not a natural law but a choice.
  - Perspective is a choice.
- Artificial lenses may be shifted and we may choose that.

### Key Takeaway

- Seeing is never neutral. Every era builds an optical order.
- Linear perspective reorganized the world, placing the viewer at the center and turning space into something measurable, ownable, governable.
- From brunelleschi's peephole to Leonardo's maps, vision became a technology of control; a wau to manage land, bodies and resources
- Modernity inherited this gaze. Cities, landscapes and even people were redesigned to fit the view from above, the view of the instituions, markets and administrations
- Contemporary artists mimc powers viewpoint to reveal it's logic and fracture perspective to restor conflict, memory and multiplicity.

## More on perspective

- During a horses Gallop, do all four hooves ever leave the ground?
  - Lots of artists argued because at that time, only the human eye could see and the eye was too slow to perceive the 4 hooves leaving the ground, but later through camera and film, it was proven that they do leave the ground at one point. (the horse in motion)
- When photography took off, Charles Beaudelaire said that photography was the refuge of failed artists.
- The Kinetoscope was the forerunner of the motion
- Kino-eye - "more perfect than the human eye".
- Camera exposed uncosious structures within vision
- Man Ray abandonned the lens by placing object directly on light sensitive paper while exposing them to lights
- Harold edgerton went in the opposite direction with his experiments
- Michael Wesely explored slowness, for example documenting MOMA reconstruction, like a single frame timelapse

- What other device can reveal what the human eye cannot see
  - thermal photography, microscope, telescope, kaleidoscope, xray, radiowaves

### Key takeaways

- Photography and film roke the monopoly of the human eye. Vision became mechanical, repeatable, mobile.
- Machines began to see what we could not: the too-fast, the too-small, the too-distant, the hidden. The camera re-edited perception, revealing an optical unconscious beneath ordinary sight.
- Once vision is mediated ,reality is no longer singular. It can be frozen, stretched, dissected, accumulated, or haunted.

## 👻 Part 3: Photography and Death - The Paradox of the Image

- Roland Barthes called the photograph a paradox: it is both "here it is" and "this has been"
- Question: do you backup your photos because you fear forgetting or because you fear losing them.
  - **My answer** I feat forgetting. I backup my memories in a sense.
- See **Erik Kessels** (24hrs in photos). We are getting drowned in memories
- The initial promise of photography to safekeep our memories is now threatening us to bury them through overload.
- Archiving become this pathology of preservation
- "Too much memory is a sickness" - (**Nietzche**)
- **Joachim Schmid**says to stop overflooding the planet with new images
  - He collects discarded images that already exists, to reorganizing them in themes.

## 📺 Part 4: Society of the Spectacle - When Images Become Events

- **Guy Debord** ( la societe du spectacle )
- The Yes Men, Fake news (if it looks like news, it is news)
  - Legitimacy belongs to the frame and not to the source or content.
- **Thomas Demand**. He start by taking a low resolution of a news event, then reconstruct the scene in paper and cardboard in life size, then take a high resolution image of that scene and then destroys the model construction so that the photography is the only surviving object (triple mediation)
  - History as spectacle.
- Jean Baudrillard : Simulacra and Simultion - Copies no longer refer to the original
- Images as organizer of reality.
- "The camera never lies" - people in the early 1900s took double exposure ghostly image as proofs.

## 🎬 Part 5: Montage - Controlling Sequence, Controlling Reality

- War of the worlds started a panic because the form of the content was through radio news and people mistook it for reality. (not because the story was realistic)
- Sergei Eisenstein. The person behind the camera is controlling everything.
  - "Montage is a collision of images that manufactures thought"
  -
- **The Clock** by **Christian Marclay**
  - The experience was done by normal people, where incapable of watching scenes without narrating it.
  - There is no plot, but something strange happens because we anticipate what kind of scene will come left.
  - Narratives is not only produced by filmmakers but also by the viewers mind.
  - **Our mind insist on creating a narratives**

  ### "We cannot tolerate **randomness**, we have to turn it **into meaning.**"

- Montage is powerful tool because it controls the narrative in our minds
- **Andy Wharhol** - **Watching** becomes an act of **strained expectation**

## 📺 Part 6: Television - The Living Room Ideology Machine

- 1953: 2/3 of American households owned TV
- 1960s: Almost 90%
- Average viewer: Hours every day in front of screen

**Susan Sontag (1977):** The rise of **"aesthetic consumerism"**

- people need reality confirmed and experience intensified through images. To live increasingly meant to consume life photographically.

#### "Seeing the world no longer meant witnessing it directly; it meant watching it delivered" - Susan Sontag

Early video artist decided that telivision shaped society then it must be crictisized by using it's own tool, as it's own material.

in 75 sony released it's first handheld videocamera. Which meant artist could record movies without needing studio equipement.

**Nam June Paik:** Treated television as both toy and weapon

- **Magnet TV:** Placed powerful magnet on working TV—picture warped, collapsed into abstract currents. Evening news dissolved into pure signal. Revealed: what appeared authoritative was fragile electronic code
- **TV Buddha:** Bronze Buddha watches itself watching itself in infinite loop—enlightenment caught in endless self-observation (**can also be interpreted as a trap for the mind**)
- **Electronic Superhighway:** Hundreds of monitors map the United States—information becomes noise
  - He predicted and exposed today internet network, social media,etc.
  - Since he shown pictures to us and mapped it on the united states, meant we knew we were being manipulated and that it's all just image and noise

**Wolf Vostell:** The television is the sculpture of the 20th century.

- By moving the tv out of the home into the gallery, he's trying to strip it out of its original concept.
- Showing that it's a machine delivering ideologies, fears and deisres. Once it is isoleted from the comfort of my couch, then it can be confronted.

**Who is the product of the television??**

- Is it the program or the viewer?
  - Clearly it's **the viewer**

**"You are the end product delivered en masse to the advertiser" - Richard serra - Television delivrers people (1973)**

Attention, data, it all hides behind entertainment, dopamine seduction.

### Artists Hijacking the Medium

**Douglas Davis - _The Last Nine Minutes_ (1977):** Addresses viewers directly through screen as if private conversation

- You feel seen but cannot respond
- **Paradox:** Simulates connection while keeping viewers isolated
- The fourth wall breaks but only on one side. it is the great tragedy of television.

**Dara Birnbaum - _Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman_ (1978-79):** Cheerful commercials for facial tissues alternate rapidly with war/violence footage

- Tragedy and consumption become interchangeable units
- **TV's most dangerous trick:** Not censorship, but emotional leveling

Artists used television to show how telivion work.

**mamyshev-monroe** hijacked tv by using the code from state media to deliver absurd content. The content is not important but how it is packaged to the user.

**media burn - 1975** Literal confrontation of the tv by using a car to crash into them.

#### Key Takeaway

- Images began as record of moments, but it gradually becam structures that organize memory itself. The past no longer lived only in minds or rituals but in archives, databases, feeds and screens. Memories shifted from lived experience to stored representation and soon from storage to overload
- The image stoped documenting events and began producing them instead: shaping public opinion, collective emotion and social belief.
- Montage, broadcast and mass media revealed whoever controls image sequence controls attention -- and whoever controls attention organizes reality
- By the late 20th century, television and mass imagery became the environment in which the world appears.
- The central condition of contemporary life: we do not live events, **We live their images**

## 💻 Part 7: Digital Logic - When Images Become Data

### Nancy Burson - The Calculated Face (1980s)

Pioneered digital morphing:

- Scanned faces with digitizer, translated portraits into numerical coordinates
- Computer distorted first face to match second, blending them
- **Not photographed, not painted—calculated**
- Co-created first patented facial morphing software (later adopted by FBI)

- This was used later by FBI to craft aged photos of missing children
- Was also used as a control technology (face recognition)
- Her work merged art and science decades before it was mainstream.

**Warhead 1:** Merged faces of Reagan, Brezhnev, Mitterrand, Thatcher
**2018 Time Magazine:** Merged Trump and Putin

**Result:** Human face becomes data set. Identity becomes something that can be computed, modified, generated—**no longer bound to a body**.

Images are no longer fixed frames—they are **modular units** (pixels, files, data sets) that can be stored, sorted, searched, recombined, generated.

**Database logic:** Meaning no longer arises from linear storytelling but from structure, correlation, accumulation, algorithmic recombination

### Manovich's Five Principles

1. **Numerical Representation:** Digital images are made of numbers
2. **Modularity:** Digital elements remain independent building blocks (clips, pixels, files can be rearranged without destroying whole) that can be rearranged without destroying the whole
3. **Automation:** Software can operate on images automatically, ie: Morphing faces, recognizing patterns, generating sequences, predicting behavior
4. **Variability:** No digital image has singular final form. It can be resized, recolored, recompressed, regenerated endlessly
5. **Transcoding:** New media lives in two layers that reshape each other:

- The cultural layer: Human meanings, like a photo's story
- The computer layer: Code, algorithms, data
  A face become both art and an editable pixel array; Culture gets rewritten by software, logic and vice versa...

### Artists Working with These Principles

**Dan Sandin - Sandin Image Processor (1971-74):** Analog video computer

- "Video equivalent of Moog synthesizer"
- Accepts video signals, modulates them through voltage/oscillation/feedback
- Refused to patent it—distributed schematics so others could build their own

**Steina & Woody Vasulka - Rutt Etra Video Synthesizer:** Treated TV signal as raw material

- **Violin Power:** Steina plays violin—sound feeds directly into video synthesizer. Her bow strokes control the image. She's not accompanying an image, **she's playing it directly**

**Ture Sjölander - Swedish Monument (1960s):** Hijacked Swedish TV, converting film to video signals mid-transfer

- Chaplin melts, sculptures stretch, leaders dissolve
- Cultural monuments infected by electronic disease

**Max Almy - _Leaving the 20th Century_ (1982):** Three-part narrative using computer graphics

- **Countdown:** Man receives daily input directly into head through TV signals
- **Departure:** Woman leaves because nothing good on television, but wanders lost without screen
- **Arrival:** Figures trapped in digital void of failed transmissions
- Bodies float like detached objects—proto-database where humans are searchable, non-interactive fragments

**Lev Manovich - _Soft Cinema_:** Builds database of video clips, images, text, soundtracks

- Software assembles film in real time following compositional rules + controlled randomness
- "Semi-automatic film jockey"—**cinema that performs itself**
- Every screening produces different constellation—film never repeats

**Cory Arcangel - _Super Mario Clouds_ (2002):** Hacked Super Mario Brothers cartridge

- Erased all sound/visual elements except scrolling blue sky with pixel clouds
- Game still runs but nothing happens
- Isolates single graphic module, reveals hidden construction
- **Code becomes landscape**

#### Key Takeaway

- Images are no longer singular frames or sequences. they are modular elements that can be stored, sorted, recombined and generated.
- Meaning emerges from structure, correlation and permutation
- Once vision becomes data, the body becomes describable, the face becomes calculable, identity becomes editable
- Narrative does not organize images anymore, Images organize the narrative.

### Unfinished experiments

- Can we invent ways of seeing that do not convert the world into resource?
- What counts as eviddence in an age of synthetic images? When images no longer guarantee a referent, how do we ground knowledge?
- Vision has become a field of governance. Who has the right to see, show or hide content.
- If time becomes navigable, what happens to memoery, forgetting and responsibility??
