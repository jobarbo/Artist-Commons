## 🎯 Key Takeaway

This session reframed art critique from an intimidating exercise into a supportive, skill-building practice that empowers artists to speak confidently about art through structured observation and evidence-based interpretation.

## 📋 The Feldman Framework

A four-step method for analyzing artwork that builds meaning systematically:

### 1. **Describe**

- State the obvious facts
- What do you see? (colors, shapes, figures, materials)
- No interpretations or judgments—just observable evidence
- _Goal: Build a foundation someone could visualize without seeing the work_

### 2. **Analyze**

- Examine the relationships between elements
- How is it organized? (composition, foreground/background, use of space)
- Apply **elements of art**: line, color, shape, texture, value, space, form, time
- Apply **principles of design**: contrast, emphasis, pattern, repetition, variety, proportion, rhythm, movement, balance, harmony, unity
- _Goal: Understand formal/visual organization_

**Key Distinction:** Describe is "what do you see?" (facts and concrete) while Analyze is "more adjectives" (relationships and qualities). Example: "The man is wearing canvas shoes" = describe; "The shoes look worn" = analyze.

### 3. **Interpret**

- What do these relationships mean?
- Consider cultural, historical, and personal contexts
- Make connections backed by evidence from steps 1 & 2
- _Goal: Derive meaning from observable facts_

**Important:** The first two steps are mostly **formal**; this step is **conceptual**. Don't change or ignore visual facts to make your interpretation work.

### 4. **Evaluate**

- Is the artwork effective in what it's trying to do?
- Based on your interpretation and the artist's intent
- Recognize your own evaluative lens (see theories below)

**Remember:** Many times evaluation can be skipped—we already know how to judge. The first three steps train us to really see.

## 🎨 Elements of Art & Principles of Design

**Elements = Ingredients:**

- Color, Line, Shape, Texture, Value, Space, Form, Time

**Principles = Recipe:**

- Contrast, Emphasis, Pattern, Repetition, Variety, Proportion, Rhythm, Movement, Balance, Harmony, Unity

These are all **formal** elements—related to the form the art takes. Visual analysis always starts with form before moving into meaning.

## 🔍 Four Theories of Art Evaluation

Understanding which lens you use helps recognize your biases and evaluation position:

### **Formalist**

- Values mastery of elements and principles of design
- Focus: composition, color, line, technique
- "Art for art's sake"
- Example: Josef Albers' _Homage to the Square_

### **Imitationalist/Realist**

- Values artwork that accurately represents reality
- Focus: proportions, perspective, lifelike detail
- Essentially a "copy" of real life
- Example: Robert Bechtle's _'61 Pontiac_ (1968-1969)

### **Expressivist/Emotionalist**

- Values emotional impact and expression
- Focus: feeling, mood, visceral response
- Excellent work can even be "ugly" if emotionally powerful
- Example: Käthe Kollwitz's _Woman with Dead Child_

### **Instrumentalist**

- Values communication of ideas/messages
- Focus: political, social, or moral concepts
- Art should serve a purpose beyond itself
- Example: Nick Cave's _Sound Suits_, Yoko Ono's _Cut Piece_

**Tip:** You might favor one or two, with a hierarchy that can shift over time. Knowing your default lens strengthens how you interpret and evaluate.

## 🖼️ Artworks Analyzed

### **Faith Ringgold - _American People Series Number 20: Die_ (1967)**

**Medium:** Oil on canvas (two panels, 6 ft × 12 ft)

**Context:** Created during civil rights era to document race and class struggles, challenging media silence on street violence

**Key Observations:**

- 13 figures (10 adults, 3 children) in violent confrontation
- Checkerboard background (18 gray squares) representing sidewalk from above
- Figures appear as repeated types with identical dress
- Flat planes of color—like paper cutouts
- Blood on all except two children huddled at center
- Unclear who are perpetrators vs. victims

**Interpretation:** "Abstraction of what the fights were really all about"—systemic violence maintaining social hierarchies. Modeled after Picasso's _Guernica_. The artist deliberately upsets viewers to confront reality. The central children represent innocence caught in cycles of violence.

**Artist's Words:** "I want you to be upset. You're not supposed to see people rioting and killing each other...without being upset. This was going on then. It's happening again now."

### **Henry Ossawa Tanner - _The Banjo Lesson_ (1893)**

**Context:** Post-Civil War America; African American artist challenging stereotypical depictions

**Key Observations:**

- Intimate scene: older man teaching young boy
- Two light sources (warm and cool)
- Modest dwelling, household objects scattered
- Figures centered but background light is brightest
- Most refined details on faces and hands
- Warm light on boy's forehead (knowledge transfer)
- Pan handle mirrors banjo shape

**Interpretation:** Dignified portrayal of intergenerational knowledge transfer and family bonds. Stark contrast to demeaning minstrel stereotypes common at the time. Celebrates hope, cultural transmission, and human connection. The word "hope" emerged repeatedly in discussion—all they have is the banjo as source of joy.

**Historical Context:** Images of Black men with banjos were typically stereotypical caricatures. This painting pushed back against that, presenting dignity instead of degradation.

### **Jack Whitten - _9.11.01_ (2006)**

**Materials:** Acrylic, ash, blood, hair, mixed media on canvas (large mosaic)

**Key Observations:**

- Large dark pyramid against ordered blue grid background
- Mosaic tiles: ordered on background, chaotic on pyramid
- Boot prints with text ("daily news," "remember")
- Magazine cutouts, single eye visible
- Earthen tones at edges vs. dark ominous center
- Made from actual ash and blood from 9/11 site

**Interpretation:** Memorial responding to September 11, 2001. Ordered background vs. chaotic pyramid suggests structure "coming undone." Visceral and documentary through personal materials. The "shedding" quality evokes transformation and trauma.

## 💡 Key Insights from Jerry Saltz

> **"What would I like about this artwork if I were the kind of person who liked it?"**

This question opens perspective and reduces defensiveness, helping you approach art with objectivity.

**Other wisdom:**

- Talk about art the way you talk about everything—don't sound like an academic
- Trust yourself and your "stupid thoughts"
- Ask: How was this made? When? What did other art look like then?
- See as much as you can. Keep looking, never stop looking
- Everything is a little bit figurative, even abstract art
- Ask strangers what they think—you'll be amazed

**Fun fact:** Jerry Saltz was a long-haul truck driver for a decade after "failing" as an artist before becoming a renowned critic.

## 🔑 Practical Takeaways

1. **Slow down.** Adults tend to jump past describe/analyze straight to interpret/evaluate
2. **Build from evidence.** Your interpretation must be supported by what you observed
3. **State the obvious.** It creates a solid, objective foundation
4. **Start simple, add qualifiers.** "An older man and young boy" → eventually "grandfather teaching grandson"
5. **Long seeing.** Your relationship with artwork evolves over time through description
6. **Recognize your lens.** Know which evaluation theory you favor
7. **Context matters—but comes after observation.** Historical/cultural info enriches interpretation but follows visual evidence
8. **Where you start matters.** What you notice first is information about yourself

## 🗨️ Important Clarifications

**On the difference between Describe and Analyze:**

- **Describe:** "The man is wearing canvas shoes" (pure fact)
- **Analyze:** "The shoes look worn" (quality/relationship—still formal, still surface)
- **Interpret:** "He's probably poor" (meaning, backed by evidence)

**On materials and technique:**

- As a maker, share methodology if it's important to you
- But recognize it may be a side note to some, crucial to others
- Material and technique CAN be part of the concept (e.g., labor of making)
- Visual analysis doesn't happen in a vacuum—context shifts meaning

**On evaluation:**

- Don't START by asking if it meets your criteria for excellence—that's LAST
- Base judgment on philosophy of art, not "I like it/I don't like it"
- We're already born knowing how to judge—practice seeing instead
- The goal isn't consistency in judgments but increasing the range of ideas, values, and satisfactions you get from art

## 📚 Why This Matters

As adults, we're not very practiced at **seeing**. We rush to judgment. This framework:

- Encourages thorough examination
- Slows tendency to jump to conclusions
- Builds observation skills vital for understanding visual arts
- Creates shared vocabulary for discussing art
- Helps establish group consensus about visual evidence
- Makes space to see in new ways and get outside our own heads

**Professor Rudolph's closing thought:**
_"It's not about filling out a form—can you see yourself doing these steps in your practice anytime you're looking at artwork? Just describe what you see and ask yourself, what would I like about this if I was the type of person who liked it?"_

---

## 🎓 For Your Practice

This is what you'll practice in:

- Close looking activities
- Feedback sessions in cohorts throughout the year
- Whenever you encounter new artwork

**The transformation:** When you let artwork enter your life and transform it uniquely through patient observation, you discover what an aesthetic experience truly is.
