## The Four Stages of Art Criticism

### I. Description

**Purpose:** Listing what an art object seems to include

**Key Principles:**

- Be as specific as possible
- Describe as if to someone who hasn't seen the work
- **Do not jump to conclusions**
- Use **neutral language only** - avoid value judgments
- Banned terms: strong, beautiful, harmonious, weak, disorderly, ugly, funny-looking, etc.
- When uncertain, be vague rather than incorrect (e.g., say "some people" instead of guessing gender)

**What to Describe:**

1. **Recognizable subjects** (for representational works)
   - Objects with common names: man, tree, lake, grass, children, animals, sky

2. **Visual elements and their qualities** (especially for abstract/non-objective works)
   - Elements: lines, colors, textures, shapes, forms, spaces
   - Use descriptive adjectives: vertical, round, oval, smooth, dark, bright, square, horizontal
   - Combine adjectives with nouns for precision

3. **Technical qualities**
   - How the object seems to have been made
   - Media and tools used
   - How materials were manipulated
   - _Note: Technique is just as expressive as the shapes and forms_

**Remember:** Description is neutral. Your language should refer only to visual evidence.

### II. Analysis

**Purpose:** Describing relationships among the things listed; finding out how parts interact

Also known as **formal or structural analysis**

**Things to Analyze:**

1. **Size relationships**
   - Compare sizes to determine importance (larger = more important/"higher rank")
   - Identify largest, smallest, and similarly-sized elements
   - Size as clue to spatial location

2. **Shape relationships**
   - How shapes combine
   - Curved vs. angular/pointed shapes
   - Jagged vs. smooth shapes
   - Quality of edges (hard/soft, even/uneven)

3. **Color relationships**
   - Similarities vs. differences
   - Slight variation vs. strong contrast
   - Value relationships (lighter/darker)
   - Colors may differ while values remain the same

4. **Textural surface relationships**
   - Actual vs. illusionary texture
   - Similar vs. different surfaces
   - Slight variation vs. strong contrast
   - Reveals emotional qualities and ideas

5. **Space and volume relationships**
   - Location of forms (foreground/background)
   - How space is implied (perspective, overlap, size, placement, color, light/shadows)
   - Type of space: indefinite/open/endless vs. limited/enclosed
   - Negative space and its effect on positive shapes

**Intentions of Description & Analysis:**

- Encourage thorough examination
- Slow tendency to jump to conclusions
- Build observation skills (vital for understanding visual arts)
- Accumulate "visual facts" for interpretation
- Establish group consensus about visual evidence

### III. Interpretation

**Purpose:** Deciding what all your earlier observations mean

Making **inferences** (good guesses/hypotheses) about the meaning of visual evidence

**Important:**

- Don't be afraid to propose interpretations
- You may adjust interpretations to fit visual facts
- **Do not change or ignore visual facts to make your interpretation seem correct**
- Beginners often make illogical inferences—avoid this

**Guides for Interpretation:**

1. **Is there a "big" idea?**
   - Identify a single large concept that unifies all traits
   - Use words for ideas, not objects

2. **How does the work affect you?**
   - Explain sensations and feelings

3. **Does it connect with your experience as an artist?**
   - Recognize technical signs
   - Identify problems the artist is trying to solve

4. **How does it connect with your knowledge about art?**
   - Reflect on art history and styles
   - Identify persistent artistic problems (meaning, form, social function)

5. **How does it connect with your knowledge of life?**
   - Trust yourself
   - Draw on observations, hunches, intelligence
   - Don't reject "looks like" or "feels like" reactions
   - Odd impressions may offer fundamental insights

**Why Interpret?**
If you let the artwork enter your life and transform it uniquely, you've discovered what an aesthetic experience is.

### IV. Judgment

**Purpose:** Deciding the value of an art object

**Key Principles:**

- Reasons for judgment are relative to context and purpose
- Base judgment on **philosophy of art**, not personal preferences
- Avoid "I like it" or "I don't like it" as justification

**Three Philosophies for Judgment:**

#### A. Formalism

_Stresses formal qualities and visual elements_

**Criteria:**

1. Experience devoted to contemplating relationships of parts to whole
2. Each part enhances surrounding parts
3. Cannot change single element without spoiling whole work
4. Viewer should feel unity/wholeness (too much/little emotion = flawed)
5. Pleasure comes from art object itself—surfaces, colors, visual qualities
6. Feelings/ideas depend only on how artist shapes materials
7. Rejects art relying on symbols, subject matter, or viewer's experience
8. "Art for art's sake"—no other reason needed
9. **Masterpiece:** Perfect visual organization and technical execution

#### B. Expressivism

_Stresses communication of ideas and feelings convincingly and forcefully_

**Criteria:**

1. Interested in depth and intensity of experience
2. Excellent work could be ugly
3. Good formal/technical organization necessary (or can't affect feelings)
4. Two basic rules:
   - Best work has greatest power to arouse emotions
   - Best work communicates ideas of major significance
5. Art should be based on reality, not other art
6. Should not look calculated—inevitable result of what artist saw/felt deeply
7. Should make everyday life more meaningful and profound
8. Viewer must believe what they see; genuineness of artist's actual emotions doesn't matter

#### C. Instrumentalism

_Stresses social intention or utility_

**Criteria:**

1. Art should serve purposes determined by persistent human needs through powerful institutions
2. Should serve church, state, business, or politics
3. Best when advancing a cause for humanity's interests
4. Art depending on/growing from art is inferior, self-serving, or decadent
5. Excellence measured by capacity to change human behavior publicly (political art → party allegiance; religious art → faith)
6. Artist's gifts organized by idea greater than private emotions
7. **Masterpiece:** Good meanings + perfectly organized forms (closest connection between appearance and social intention)

## Final Advice

**Process Order:**

1. ✅ Identification and Description
2. ✅ Analysis
3. ✅ Interpretation
4. ✅ Judgment (last!)

**Do NOT** start by asking if work meets your criteria for excellence.

**Flexibility:** Use philosophies interchangeably according to the artwork's character rather than rigidly sticking to one.

**The Real Goal:** Not to demonstrate consistency in judgments, but to **increase the range of ideas, values, and satisfactions you get from art**.
