Summary:

Reframed critique as a skill-building practice meant to support artists, reduce intimidation, and develop confidence in speaking about art.

Taught the Feldman framework: Describe → Analyze → Interpret → Evaluate, with strong emphasis on slowing down and building meaning from observable evidence rather than jumping to immediate judgment.

Introduced the elements of formal analysis and art and principles of design as the vocabulary for analyzing composition, relationships, and visual emphasis before moving into conceptual interpretation.

Modeled how interpretation and evaluation should be grounded in what’s visible first, followed by historical and cultural context, which bring different lenses the mold everyone's final evaluation of a work.

Outlined four positions from which artists can approaches the evaluation of an artwork (formalist, imitationalist/realist, expressivist/emotionalist, instrumentalist) and why knowing your default lens strengthens how you might interpret and evaluate an artwork.

Students finished with guided visual analysis exercises on Henry Ossawa Tanner’s The Banjo Lesson (1893) and Jack Whitten’s 9.11.01 (2006).
