- Whenever the first thing you notice in an artwork is, is good information for yourself but also check what other people pick on first.
- Question from James Merill, Does the way the work was created (self imposed limitation, material) and talking about it can detract from the work
- if you feel like the methodology behind the creation gets you excited enough that you want to share it, then it's part of your approach and it's context, but we don't analyze in a vacuum. An artwork will not keep a static meaning accross time. it might be relevant to some and not for other, it's all about context.
-Title cards, found in artwork during exhibits, these info clues us in with context in how to read the artwork (time period, medium, etc);

Step:1 - Description tips:
- Describe what you see in the artwork (STATE OBVIOUS)
- In enough detail that a person not in front of the artwork can visualize it from my words.

Step:2 - Analysis tips:
- How did the artist visually orghanize the composition
- what is in the foreground, middle groun, background? What occupy those layers/space?
- what color are used and how are they arranged
- what shapes are there and how are they arranged>
- Is there some structural lines? Where does your eye lead.
- Check for use of contrast, pattern, space, if so, where?
- Any special techniques used?

Step:3 - Interpret tips:
- Why would they use a special technique for this piece
- What is the significance of the combination of elements in that artwork
- What do you associatge with this work?
- Is there a theme? If so what is it?
- Is there a mood or feeling being conveyed?
- As long as you interpret the work through the information that you have, then the interpretation stands, as long as you can support it.
