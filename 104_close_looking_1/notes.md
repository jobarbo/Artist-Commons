The scenes both shows multiple scenes.
70,80,90s and nostalgic toys value

Surealistic vibes
War thorn vs utopic surealistic
Duality of gender?
Dreamers on the bottom right
Some element are very huge while other are small models
Speed is constant on both side
The scene is looping
The element/models are sync on both feed

## Piece 3

Moving scene
Shows stops motorized vehicles,
Building walls with Broken windows
The terrain is very sandy/dirty
Very little signs of human life
Trash lying on the ground
Lots of clothing on clothes line
Weird distorted sound
Speed is constant
Lots of satellite dishes

# Analyze

Seems like a middle eastern city
There is no judgment, no emotion, just pur facts about this place
Seems like a looping circular motion like the dream sequence
Lots of construction vehicles but no new construction in sight.
Camera/driver is going left in a circular pattern.
Industrial district
Lots of japanese cars

# interpret

The city is stagnating,or the construction are elsewhere
From the sound, life there is all noise.
There is contrast in how everything is dirty but the cars
Everything looks the same,groundhog days for them.
The sound is also very mushy with no real distinction.
Lots of white cars (purity ?)
