# Jennifer & Kevin McCoy Presentation - Wrap-Up

## Overview

Jennifer and Kevin McCoy are collaborative artists who co-author all their work together. They discuss their 25+ year practice spanning video art, sculpture, installation, and digital media. Their work explores the intersection of cinema, databases, technology, and physical sculpture.

## Key Themes in Their Practice

### Collaborative Philosophy

- **Decision**: Early on, they chose to co-author all work under one name rather than compete for opportunities
- **Strategy**: They create a "third body of work" that is neither what Kevin nor Jennifer would make individually
- **Process**: Ongoing conversation where ideas loop back and forth; not bureaucratic, always evolving

### Art as Practice

- View art-making as a practice (like meditation or athletics) focused on continuous improvement
- Emphasize that **art-making is an end in itself**—professionalization and markets are downstream
- Acknowledge that work is 99% uncertainty; the polished presentation glosses over countless doubts along the way

## Major Projects & Artistic Evolution

### Early Database Work (2001)

**"Every Shot, Every Episode" (Starsky & Hutch)**

- Deconstructed the entire first season using film theory categories
- Created a physical database: 278 discs displayed on gallery shelves with labels like "every stairway," "every disguise"
- Pioneered what became known as "supercuts" (alongside Christian Marclay)
- Labor-intensive production; essential lesson: **sometimes you can't assess if an idea works until you see it through completely**

### Miniature Works with Live Video (Mid-2000s onward)

**"Our Second Date"**

- Recreated a scene from Jean-Luc Godard's _Weekend_ in miniature (a car wreck)
- Built a miniature cinema with live cameras that cut between two narrative spaces: the Godard film and Jennifer & Kevin watching it
- Key insight: Using miniatures and live cameras to create live cinema

**"Horror Chase"**

- All 278 different takes of one shot from _Evil Dead 2_ shot on Super 16mm film
- Computer algorithm randomly chooses takes, direction, and speed
- Creates "endlessness"—viewers never see the same sequence twice
- Demonstrates commitment to future-proofing: has been rescanned and reauthored multiple times (320x240 pixels → 4K resolution)
- Now in Whitney Museum's permanent collection

**"The Kiss"**

- Similar structure to Horror Chase but with one kiss from _The Postman Always Rings Twice_
- Shot on 35mm film

### Mini Projects Exploring Fandom

A series of tiny sculptural works that physically recreated iconic cinema moments:

- Explored the connection between fan and art object
- Featured Kevin and Jennifer positioned within recreated film scenes
- Examples: miniature recreations of scenes from _Weekend_, _Star Trek_, _Kung Fu_

### Large-Scale Installations

**"The Dreadnought"**

- Commissioned for "Models as Muse" exhibition at Addover College
- Animated a priceless model ship without moving it—instead, moved the camera around it
- Challenges: motorized track, wireless video, capacitors to smooth power flow
- Whimsical result: waves ended up much larger than the ship, creating a comically dramatic effect

**"Constant World"**

- Commission from British Film Institute/Hayward Gallery, London
- Four chandeliers create film on a massive screen
- References Godard's _Alphaville_ and situationist architect Constant's utopian city designs
- Physical text (laser-cut plexiglass) serves as 3D subtitles
- Black-and-white aesthetic with color flares; traveled to six venues after initial installation

## Digital Art & NFTs (2010s)

### "Quantum" - First NFT (2014)

- **Significance**: Recognized as the first digital artwork with a blockchain record (first NFT)
- Source: Animated GIF derived from Processing code; animation originally from a miniature project
- **Key Insight**: Uniqueness comes from the blockchain record, not the artwork itself—they are two separate systems that need to be linked
- Presented at the New Museum, NYC, with Anil Dash

### Failed Platform Attempt: Monograph (2015-2016)

- Attempted to create a platform allowing artists to put works on-chain and buy/sell them
- Launched before Ethereum was fully established; market wasn't ready
- Kevin burned out; the technology later evolved differently (crypto punks, etc.)
- **Lesson**: Being too early means being "screwed"—the idea had to wait for broader infrastructure

### Current Engagement

- Re-engaged with NFT community and collector scene after initial burnout
- Believe the concept of digital ownership is too important to disappear

---

## Recent Work: Short Film Series (2010s onward)

### "Broker" (2016)

- 20-minute short film about a luxury real estate broker
- Shot in Trump Tower luxury apartment as set
- Uses surveillance-style cameras (Nest, Home, Yi-style)
- Includes an operatic section with 10-minute song about marketing (lyrics from internet)
- Explores luxury spaces and late capitalism
- Shown primarily as looping installation

### "Cleaner" & "Quitter"

- Part of 10-year odyssey of three shorts
- Details to be continued/elaborated in upcoming discussions

---

## Approach to Production & Problem-Solving

- **Setting rules**: Often establish constraints to define projects (e.g., every cut in Starsky & Hutch equals original editor's choices)
- **Elaborate production processes**: Accept that you can't assess success until completion
- **Hands-on technical innovation**: Kevin writes custom software; both collaborate on mechanical and engineering challenges
- **Scale as creative tool**: Work across different scales (tiny miniatures to large installations)
- **Future-proofing**: Deliberately plan for technological evolution and preservation

## Keys to Longevity in Art Practice

1. **Collaboration as strategy**: Breaking down divisions between art and life
2. **Focus on practice over market**: Let professionalization be downstream
3. **Commitment to ideas over outcomes**: Trust the process even with uncertainty
4. **Conservation & preservation mindset**: Work with institutions and conservators; recognize that digital media requires ongoing care
5. **Staying curious**: Engage with emerging technologies (blockchain, NFTs) as artists rather than dismissing them
6. **Finding institutional support**: Museums, galleries, and professional conservators enable complex work to survive and thrive

## Visiting Artist Purpose (per Haber's intro)

- Show the **arc of a career**: how one project leads to the next
- Demonstrate that there are many ways to be an artist and move through the art world
- Provide a roadmap for emerging artists to imagine their own paths
- Enable students to identify themes and approaches that resonate with their own practice
