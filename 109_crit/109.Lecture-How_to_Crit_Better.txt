 question or a next step to try

THE LANGUAGE WE SHOULD USE
USE "I" STATEMENTS
"
I notice…"
"I'm confused by…"
"I'm curious about…"
BACK UP YOUR PERSPECTIVE WITH EVIDENCE
"
I felt _________ because…"
"Because the lighting does _________, I read it as…"
NO CERTAINTY LANGUAGE
"
Obviously"
"Always"
"Never"
"Everyone will…"
USE "PERHAPS" OR "MIGHT" OR "ONE POSSIBILITY"
A
void should statements like: "you should do _________"
Instead open a path of possibility: "I would be curious 
to see what would happen if…"

CRITIQUE CRAFT CHOICES, NOT THE PERSON
This includes not critiquing their motives or taste:
MOTIVE
D
on't ascribe motive or psychologize them.
"You're afraid to…" or "You want attention…"
TASTE
D
on't impose your taste or judge other people's taste. 
"I don't like digital art" or "I don't get abstract art" 
is not feedback.

THE ARTIST'S RIGHTS
THE ARTIST CAN ASK FOR WHAT THEY 
N
EED
Request more craft notes, more 
talk about the meaning of the 
work, or just questions.
THE ARTIST DOESN'T NEED TO 
R
ESPOND TO ALL FEEDBACK
Simply say "Noted" and move on 
(no debate required).
THE ARTIST CAN HIT PAUSE
Y
ou can pause the feedback 
session if it becomes unproductive 
or unsafe.

The Presenting Artist always has power here. This Feedback Session is for you. We are for you. 
We are here to help you get out of your head. To help you see your work more clearly. To help 
reveal that there are a multitude of perspectives and relationships to any image. The goal is better 
next steps, not perfect consensus.

FEEDBACK FRAMEWORK (45 MIN)
1 S etup the Artwork (1–2 min)
2 S ilent Look (2 min)
3 C larifying Factual Questions (5 min)
4 F eedback: What's Working and Why (8 min)
5 F eedback: What is this about? (5 min)
6 F eedback: Effect, Intent, and Key Questions (8 min)
7 F eedback: What Could Be Stronger (10 min)
8 A rtist Reflection + Commitments (5 min)

1. SETUP THE ARTWORK
1
–2 MIN
1 W HAT THIS IS
Title/series/context
2 W HAT STAGE IT'S IN
Early/later draft
3 W HERE TO LOOK
How to access or navigate
Rule: These are only the logistics the group needs to look (number of images, order is fixed or flexible, is sound on/off, etc.) 
No sharing intent, meaning, or goals. You won't get a neutral read on the work if you do.

EXAMPLE: ARTWORK SETUP
This is called Time Explorations. These pieces are part of a series of digital works. There are eight images here made 
over the last few weeks. I'm looking to release it online for collectors in about two months. This is about a dozen hours 
of work, but it still feels like an early draft.
Make sure you click the diagonal arrow in the corner so you're seeing it full-screen when you look. You can use the 
arrow keys to flip through.

WHAT THE SETUP TIME IS NOT FOR
1 E xplaining Intent or Meaning
2 A  long backstory
3 S elf-deprecating framing
"This is bad," "Sorry it's not ready," "I hate it."
It nudges the group toward reassurance instead of analysis.
You made something. Let the work speak. We care about you. Let us come in neutral so we can 
s
ee it most clearly and be most helpful to you.

2. SILENT LOOK
2
 MIN
Everyone looks without speaking and makes notes for 
l
ater rounds. This is a chance to slow down from our 
usual pace and way of looking.

WHAT TO AVOID DOING DURING 
T
HE SILENT LOOK
No reactions out loud: "wow," "I love this," "I'm confused."
No feedback or clarifying questions (yet).
No advice in chat or side messaging.
Rule: n o talking until the silent look is done.

SIMPLE PROMPTS FOR TAKING NOTES
"I NOTICE…"
"I'M DRAWN TO…"
"I WONDER…"

THESE COULD INCLUDE
Where your attention goes first Repetition, such as forms, 
c
olors, gestures, motifs
Visual shifts in tone, scale, 
r
hythm, density, space
What feels most alive or a 
m
oment that holds you
What you're unsure about

3. CLARIFYING FACTUAL QUESTIONS
5
 MIN
These are w hat and how questions. Clarifying questions 
are for shared understanding. They help the group see 
the work accurately before anyone interprets it.

CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ARE
FACTUAL
W
hat, where, when, how
PHYSICAL
M
aterials, size, process, sequence, constraints
NON-LEADING
T
hey do not imply what should change
ANSWERABLE QUICKLY
I
deally 1 sentence long
Think: "What do I need to know to read this fairly?"

EX AMPLE: CLARIFYING FACTUAL QUESTIONS
What's the intended format (print, web, installation)?
What size is this in the real world?
Is this the final order?
What materials or tools did you use?
What parts are hand-made and which are not?
Any limits you're working within?
What is fixed and what is still flexible?
Do you have any hard deadlines or submission 
r
equirements?
Is there accompanying text or should it stand alone?
Where will this be encountered and who is the 
in
tended audience?

WHAT CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ARE NOT
INTERPRETATION QUESTIONS
"What does the red represent?"
"Is this about grief?"
"What did you have in mind when…?"
Interpretation comes later, when the group reports what they read in the work.
OPINIONS DISGUISED AS QUESTIONS
"Don't you think it would be stronger if…?"
"Have you considered making it less…?"
"Isn't the problem that…?"
"Why didn't you just…?"

PRESENTING ARTIST GUIDELINE FOR ANSWERS
ANSWER IN 1–2 SENTENCES IF YOU FEEL PULLED INTO 
M
EANING
Say: "Hold that for 
later."
IF THE QUESTION IS 
O
UTSIDE TODAY'S SCOPE
"That's not my focus for 
today, so it's not 
decided yet."
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
"
I'm not sure yet." 
That's a valid answer.

CLARIFYING FACTUAL 
Q
UESTIONS ONLY.
No opinions yet. No praise, no critique, no advice. We' re 
just information-gathering to make sure we all know 
what we're looking at. " Just the facts ma'am."

4. FEEDBACK: WHAT'S WORKING AND WHY
8
 MIN
Our first opportunity for feedback is about what is landing, not what should change. You're sharing 
with the artist what you found resonant, exciting, or memorable about a work-in-progress. We start 
with positive and non-judgmental feedback that is specific to build trust and empower the artist 
before we move into a deeper critique.
1 S hare a "what's working" or "what's strong" statement that is specific and grounded in evidence.
2 T ell the Presenting Artist what was striking about the work. ("I like…")

EXAMPLES
"I notice the repeated horizon 
lin
e. It made me feel steadier, 
because it anchors each image 
e
ven when the landscape 
changes."
"I like the pacing from image 2 
t
o 3. It made the shift feel 
dramatic, because the negative 
s
pace opens up."
"I love how the sound sits under 
t
he voice. It made the piece feel 
intimate, because that mixing 
c
hoice puts the voice in the 
foreground."

A GOOD "WHAT'S WORKING" COMMENT HAS 3 PARTS:
01
OBSERVATION
W
hat you saw/heard
02
EFFECT
W
hat it did to you as a viewer
03
EVIDENCE
W
hat in the work caused that effect
Simple formula: " I notice _________. It made me _________. Because _________."

SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT TO COMMENT ON
A
) VIEWER EXPERIENCE
What grabbed your attention first?
Where did your eye go next?
What stayed with you after looking?
B) CRAFT AND FORMAL CHOICES
Composition, palette, scale, rhythm, sequencing
Material handling, finish, clarity, consistency
Where tension is created and resolved
C) MEANING AND READING (WITHOUT INTENT CLAIMS)
What themes or questions you read
What emotions or atmosphere the work carries
What feels ambiguous in a productive way
D) COHESION AND VOICE
What makes it feel like "this artist"
What feels consistent across the series
What feels newly specific or sharpened here

WHAT'S NOT ALLOWED
VAGUE PRAISE
"It's beautiful." "It's cool." 
"
Nice work."
If it's true, make it useful by 
n
aming why.
EVALUATION LANGUAGE
"This fails." "This is weak."
The goal is to be descriptive 
a
nd responsive, not 
judgmental.
ADVICE OR SUGGESTIONS
"I like it, but you should…"
"This would be stronger if…"
"Have you considered…"

THE ARTIST'S ROLE HERE
LET YOURSELF RECEIVE.
This round of feedback is about how the work is alrea dy 
reaching people.
Take notes on what resonated. Especially if you hear 
something you hadn't realized about the work.

5. FEEDBACK: WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
5
 MIN
This round is about what the work is communicating ri ght now — what it's saying and how it's 
saying it. Many artists do not begin with a fully formed artist statement. Meaning often arrives 
through making. This step gives the artist a mirror for how much of what they put into the work is 
coming across.
We do this before the artist weighs in, and thereby weights how we're viewing the piece when, in 
the next round, they describe their intended effect and Key Questions. Right now is about naming 
what we think the work is doing, saying, or asking to help the artist hear that early meaning.

OPERATIVE QUESTION: WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT?
1. CLAIM
W
hat you think it's about
2. EVIDENCE
W
hat in the work led you there
Formula: "I read this as communicating _________ because _________."

6. FEEDBACK: EFFECT, CONTEXT, AND KEY QUESTIONS
8
 MIN
This round is where the feedback session becomes artist-led. As the artist, you finally get to share 
t
he intended effect of the work and the context behind it. You then choose what kind of help you 
want by asking 2–3 Key Questions. The group responds directly to your request.
Our goal is not to cover every concern you have about the work. Our goal is to get clarity on
pivotal choices that will move the work forward.

IN THIS ROUND, THE PRESENTING ARTIST WILL DO TWO THINGS
STATE YOUR "EFFECT SENTENCE"
D
escribe in one sentence what 
you want the viewer to experience, 
understand, or feel when they 
encounter the work. What is your 
intended effect?
DESCRIBE THE CONTEXT
I
n a minute or two, describe the 
context behind the piece(s). Keep 
it simple. The more you speak here 
the less time there is for you to 
receive feedback. Only say what is 
absolutely necessary.
ASK 2–3 KEY QUESTIONS
E
ach question should focus on a 
single decision embodied in the 
work. Our aim is to sharpen pivotal 
choices you made with clear, 
actionable feedback.
You're encouraged to come prepared with your 2–3 key questions. Though you can change them as you hear feedback.
The Cohort responds to the questions as asked, with no detours.

A STRONG KEY QUESTION IS
SINGULAR
O
ne concern/choice 
per question.
SPECIFIC
e
.g. it's about attention, 
clarity, tension, pacing, 
cohesion, etc.
ANSWERABLE
E
ach question should 
be something a viewer 
can answer from what 
they see in the work. 
They shouldn't have to 
guess or ask you to 
explain.
DECISION DRIVEN
I
t will clarify which 
direction to take.

EX AMPLES: KEY QUESTIONS
"Where does your attention go first, then second?"
"Does X feel consistent across the series?"
"Does Y help the emotional tone land?"
"What looks least resolved right now?"
"What feels unclear or underdeveloped?"

AVOID IN YOUR KEY QUESTIONS
ASKING FOR EVERYTHING AT ONCE
T
oo many questions makes feedback shallow.
Ask one Key Question at a time.
LEADING QUESTIONS
"
Do you see how it's about grief and surveillance 
capitalism?"
Ask neutral questions instead, so you don't 
accidentally box viewers into one way of seeing.

7. FEEDBACK: WHAT COULD BE STRONGER
1
0 MIN
This last round of feedback is where we move from wha t is already working to what might 
strengthen the work next. Our goal is not to redesign the entire project. Our goal is to offer a small 
number of clear, high-value possibilities that the artist can experiment with.
In this round, we offer:
INTERPRETATION EVALUATION CONSTRUCTIVE ADVICE COMPARATIVE 
S
TATEMENTS

FOUR TYPES OF FEEDBACK YOU CAN OFFER
IN
TERPRETATION/EVALUATION
"I think the work gains/loses energy when…"
"For me, the part that feels most/least coherent is…"
CONSTRUCTIVE ADVICE
"It might be worth trying…"
"I'd be curious what happens if…"
"Perhaps the next step could be…"
"One adjustment that might help is…"
"It could be interesting to see what happens if…"
COMPARATIVE STATEMENTS
"For me, compared to the rest of the works in the 
s
eries, this piece carries more weight because…"
"This one appears to answer a different question than 
t
he others because…"
"I think this image is perhaps the strongest/weakest link 
r
ight now to bridge these two sections because…"
"Perhaps this output, more than these others, points a 
w
ay forward for the rest of the project because…"

WHATEVER YOU SAY HERE SHOULD BE
1
FR
AMED AS JUST YOUR PERSPECTIVE
Using "I" and "perhaps" statements.
2
B
ACKED UP WITH EVIDENCE
"Because I see in the work…"
3
O
FFER POTENTIAL DIRECTIONS TO EXPLORE AND EXPERIMENT
"Perhaps" and "might" offer a branching path of possibilities.

EX AMPLE: WHAT COULD BE STRONGER
"The palette reads quiet, almost restrained in this abstract pie ce, because the values stay so close together. It creates a 
sense of calm for me. But my eye never finds anything to anchor on to keep my attention in the frame. I want to linger, 
but I'm finding it hard. I'm curious what would happen if you experimented with adding a couple high-contrast accents 
to create some clearer points of interest for the viewer."

8. ARTIST REFLECTION & 
C
OMMITMENTS
5 MIN
This is where the feedback becomes useful for after the 
s
ession. The goal is not to defend the work or answer 
every comment. The goal is to turn what you heard into 
clear next steps.

PRESENTING ARTIST SHARES UNINTERRUPTED
"What I'm taking…"
"What I'm not taking…"
Two concrete explorations to try before next time.
Rule: The Presenting Artist doesn't debate feedback, they synthesize it.

WHAT I'M TAKING
Name the strongest things you heard. Keep it specific.
STRONG PROMPTS:
"The pattern I noticed in your feedback was…"
"The biggest surprise for me was…"
"The most helpful clarification I got is…"
"What I want to preserve as I revise this is…"
"The tension I want to lean into is…"
"The choice I'm more confident about after hearing you is…"
"The question I want to keep working with is…"

WHAT I'M NOT TAKING
Name what you're setting aside for now, and why.
Keep it neutral. This is not rejection. It's focus.
STRONG PROMPTS:
"I'm setting aside ______ for now because it's not my priority this week."
"I'm not taking ______ because it would pull the work away fro m _______."
"I'm parking ______ until I solve ______ first."
"I'm not ready to decide ______ yet."
Rule: You don't need to justify yourself. One sentence is enough.

COMMIT TO TWO EXPLORATIONS
A good exploration is:
1
S
PECIFIC
You can tell if you did it.
2
L
IMITED AND REALISTIC
It fits in your available time and resources.
3
U
SEFUL EVEN IF IT FAILS
It teaches you something.

EXPLORATION PROMPTS
"Before next time, I'm going to experiment with…"
"I'll make two contrasting versions to explore where…"
"I'm going to remove/add/shift _______ and see what 
c
hanges."
"I'm plan to try a variation that pushes ________."
ACCOUNTABILITY:
"I'll post a progress update in the cohort WIP channel by 
_
_______."

WHAT THIS REFLECTION TIME IS NOT FOR
Re-explaining intent or the backstory
Responding to each person's comment
Asking the group new questions (save that for the cohort te xt chat)

EX AMPLE: TAKEAWAYS & EXPLORATIONS
WHAT I'M TAKING
S
everal of you responded most 
strongly to the restraint in the 
palette and the tension between 
geometry and softer marks. That 
tells me the quiet intensity is the 
strength to protect in this body of 
work.
WHAT I'M NOT TAKING
I'm setting aside the idea of adding 
text for now. I want this to stand on 
visual structure first.
EXPLORATIONS
I'm going to make two studies, one 
with a single high-contrast accent 
and one with none, and compare 
what happens to attention. I'm also 
going to push the hard/soft 
contrast further in one area and 
see whether it sharpens the central 
tension.
