# How to Crit Better - Summary

## Purpose
Create a constructive, actionable, and trust-based feedback culture for cohort sessions. Replace unstructured critique with a clear, repeatable framework that helps artists see their work more clearly and identify next steps.

## Core Agreements
- Assume goodwill.
- Multiple readings can coexist.
- Be precise (specific beats vague).
- Keep it confidential.

## Participation Guidelines
- No monologues (cap comments to 30-45 seconds).
- Raise hands; mentor calls in order; wait until everyone has spoken before speaking again.
- Quiet members commit to at least 2 contributions per presenting artist.
- Share artwork 24-48 hours before the session with no text or explanation.

## Feedback Components (Baseline)
- Observation: what you see/hear.
- Evidence: what in the work caused your response.
- Effect: what it did to you as a viewer.
- Explorations: a question or next step to try.

## Language Norms
- Use I statements ("I notice...", "I'm confused by...", "I'm curious about...").
- Back up claims with evidence ("I felt ____ because...").
- Avoid certainty language (obviously, always, never, everyone will...).
- Use possibility language (perhaps, might, one possibility...).
- Critique craft choices, not the person (avoid motive and taste judgments).

## Artist Rights
- Ask for what you need (craft notes, meaning, or questions only).
- You do not need to respond to all feedback ("Noted" is enough).
- You can pause the session if it becomes unproductive or unsafe.

## 8-Step Feedback Framework (45 minutes)
1. **Setup the artwork (1-2 min)**
   - Title/series/context, stage (early/late), where to look.
   - No intent, meaning, or goals. No self-deprecation.
2. **Silent look (2 min)**
   - No talking, reactions, or advice. Make quick notes.
   - Prompts: "I notice...", "I'm drawn to...", "I wonder...".
3. **Clarifying factual questions (5 min)**
   - What/where/when/how; materials, size, process, sequence.
   - Non-leading, answerable quickly. No interpretation or opinions.
4. **Feedback: what's working and why (8 min)**
   - Specific, evidence-based strengths. Build trust.
   - Formula: observation + effect + evidence.
5. **Feedback: what is this about? (5 min)**
   - What the work communicates right now.
   - Formula: "I read this as ____ because ____".
6. **Artist-led: effect, context, key questions (8 min)**
   - Effect sentence (what you want the viewer to feel/understand).
   - Brief context (1-2 minutes).
   - Ask 2-3 key questions (singular, specific, answerable, decision-driven).
7. **Feedback: what could be stronger (10 min)**
   - Interpretation, evaluation, constructive advice, comparative statements.
   - Use I / perhaps / might, backed by evidence, offer experiments.
8. **Artist reflection + commitments (5 min)**
   - What I'm taking, what I'm not taking.
   - Two concrete explorations; share an accountability timeline.

## Strong Key Questions (Guidelines)
- Singular: one concern per question.
- Specific: attention, clarity, tension, pacing, cohesion.
- Answerable by viewers without extra context.
- Helps you decide what to do next.

## Practical Notes From Q and A
- For larger bodies of work, share in advance; avoid showing too many pieces.
- Time-based work: share runtime so peers can plan.
- During the session, keep looking throughout to gather evidence.
- Sharing platforms: Google Drive folders (set to anyone with link), YouTube, Vimeo (limited free storage), simple private pages like Wix if needed.

## Why This Works
- Protects neutrality early so the artist hears honest first-read responses.
- Builds trust before critique.
- Centers action and accountability, not debate or defense.
